92,076-010,16,016-020,"You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"Scrooge knew he was dead"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"Of course he did"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"How could it be otherwise"
60,051-075,12,011-015,"Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years"

184,176-200,36,036-040,"And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain"
74,076-010,14,011-015,"The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started from"
38,026-050,8,006-008,"There is no doubt that Marley was dead"
99,076-010,18,016-020,"This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate"
387,more,65,more,"If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's Father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot--say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance-- literally to astonish his son's weak mind"

26,026-050,7,006-008,"It was all the same to him"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Oh"
58,051-075,10,009-010,"But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone, Scrooge"
75,076-010,9,009-010,"a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner"
133,126-150,23,021-025,"Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster"
193,176-200,34,031-035,"The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice"

127,126-150,24,021-025,"No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty"
42,051-075,8,006-008,"Foul weather didn't know where to have him"
107,101-125,20,016-020,"The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect"
56,051-075,9,009-010,"They often 'came down' handsomely, and Scrooge never did"
96,076-010,18,016-020,"Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My dear Scrooge, how are you"
28,026-050,7,006-008,"When will you come to see me"
182,176-200,37,036-040,"No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge"
239,226-250,47,046-050,"Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"But what did Scrooge care"
30,026-050,7,006-008,"It was the very thing he liked"
146,126-150,27,026-030,"To edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge"
112,101-125,20,016-020,"Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house"
227,226-250,40,036-040,"It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside, go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them"
219,201-225,39,036-040,"The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already-- it had not been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air"
162,151-175,29,026-030,"The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense without, that although the court was of the narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms"
147,126-150,26,026-030,"To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything, one might have thought that Nature lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale"
160,151-175,30,026-030,"The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters"
105,101-125,21,021-025,"Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal"
193,176-200,37,036-040,"But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part"
156,151-175,29,026-030,"Wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being a man of a strong imagination, he failed"
25,026-050,4,003-005,"'A merry Christmas, uncle"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"God save you"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"cried a cheerful voice"
124,101-125,24,021-025,"It was the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"'Bah"
21,011-025,3,003-005,"said Scrooge, 'Humbug"
198,176-200,38,036-040,"He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again"
26,026-050,4,003-005,"'Christmas a humbug, uncle"
21,011-025,3,003-005,"said Scrooge's nephew"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"'You don't mean that, I am sure"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"'I do,' said Scrooge"
16,011-025,2,000-002,"'Merry Christmas"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"What right have you to be merry"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"What reason have you to be merry"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"You're poor enough"
39,026-050,6,006-008,"'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"'What right have you to be dismal"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"What reason have you to be morose"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"You're rich enough"
75,076-010,14,011-015,"Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said, 'Bah"
38,026-050,7,006-008,"again; and followed it up with 'Humbug"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"'Don't be cross, uncle"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"said the nephew"
87,076-010,19,016-020,"'What else can I be,' returned the uncle, 'when I live in such a world of fools as this"
15,011-025,2,000-002,"Merry Christmas"
24,026-050,4,003-005,"Out upon merry Christmas"
257,251-275,48,046-050,"What's Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books and having every item in 'em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you"
205,201-225,37,036-040,"If I could work my will,' said Scrooge indignantly, 'every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"He should"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"'Uncle"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"pleaded the nephew"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"'Nephew"
87,076-010,17,016-020,"returned the uncle sternly, 'keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"'Keep it"
25,026-050,3,003-005,"repeated Scrooge's nephew"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"'But you don't keep it"
43,051-075,8,006-008,"'Let me leave it alone, then,' said Scrooge"
24,026-050,6,006-008,"'Much good may it do you"
30,026-050,7,006-008,"Much good it has ever done you"
123,101-125,23,021-025,"'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare say,' returned the nephew"
25,026-050,4,003-005,"'Christmas among the rest"
535,more,98,more,"But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys"
166,151-175,36,036-040,"And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it"
45,051-075,7,006-008,"The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded"
115,101-125,18,016-020,"Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark for ever"
108,101-125,18,016-020,"'Let me hear another sound from you,' said Scrooge, 'and you'll keep your Christmas by losing your situation"
70,076-010,12,011-015,"You're quite a powerful speaker, sir,' he added, turning to his nephew"
38,026-050,7,006-008,"'I wonder you don't go into Parliament"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"'Don't be angry, uncle"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"Come"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"Dine with us to-morrow"
54,051-075,10,009-010,"Scrooge said that he would see him--yes, indeed he did"
98,076-010,19,016-020,"He went the whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that extremity first"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"'But why"
22,026-050,3,003-005,"cried Scrooge's nephew"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"'Why"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"'Why did you get married"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"'Because I fell in love"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"'Because you fell in love"
103,101-125,19,016-020,"growled Scrooge, as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas"
15,011-025,2,000-002,"'Good afternoon"
62,076-010,12,011-015,"'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened"
42,051-075,10,009-010,"Why give it as a reason for not coming now"
30,026-050,4,003-005,"'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge"
72,076-010,15,011-015,"'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends"
30,026-050,4,003-005,"'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge"
55,051-075,12,011-015,"'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute"
59,051-075,13,011-015,"We have never had any quarrel, to which I have been a party"
95,076-010,19,016-020,"But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last"
27,026-050,5,003-005,"So A Merry Christmas, uncle"
15,011-025,2,000-002,"'Good afternoon"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
21,011-025,5,003-005,"'And A Happy New Year"
15,011-025,2,000-002,"'Good afternoon"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
63,076-010,10,009-010,"His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding"
157,151-175,30,026-030,"He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially"
159,151-175,25,021-025,"'There's another fellow,' muttered Scrooge; who overheard him: 'my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry Christmas"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"I'll retire to Bedlam"
74,076-010,13,011-015,"This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people in"
103,101-125,17,016-020,"They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge's office"
58,051-075,12,011-015,"They had books and papers in their hands, and bowed to him"
83,076-010,14,011-015,"'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,' said one of the gentlemen, referring to his list"
37,026-050,7,006-008,"'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"Scrooge, or Mr"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Marley"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"'Mr"
56,051-075,9,009-010,"Marley has been dead these seven years,' Scrooge replied"
41,051-075,8,006-008,"'He died seven years ago, this very night"
126,126-150,19,016-020,"'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner,' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials"
55,051-075,10,009-010,"It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits"
102,101-125,16,016-020,"At the ominous word 'liberality,' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back"
39,026-050,8,006-008,"'At this festive season of the year, Mr"
190,176-200,33,031-035,"Scrooge,' said the gentleman, taking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time"
107,101-125,18,016-020,"Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"'Are there no prisons"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"asked Scrooge"
66,076-010,11,011-015,"'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again"
25,026-050,4,003-005,"'And the Union workhouses"
16,011-025,2,000-002,"demanded Scrooge"
28,026-050,5,003-005,"'Are they still in operation"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"'They are"
65,076-010,12,011-015,"Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were not"
56,051-075,11,011-015,"'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"'Both very busy, sir"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"'Oh"
121,101-125,22,021-025,"I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"'I'm very glad to hear it"
226,226-250,41,041-045,"'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth"
106,101-125,20,016-020,"We choose this time, because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices"
29,026-050,7,006-008,"What shall I put you down for"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"'Nothing"
15,011-025,2,000-002,"Scrooge replied"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"'You wish to be anonymous"
39,026-050,8,006-008,"'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge"
59,051-075,12,011-015,"'Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer"
83,076-010,16,016-020,"I don't make merry myself at Christmas and I can't afford to make idle people merry"
114,101-125,20,016-020,"I help to support the establishments I have mentioned--they cost enough; and those who are badly off must go there"
47,051-075,9,009-010,"'Many can't go there; and many would rather die"
101,101-125,17,016-020,"'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population"
37,026-050,5,003-005,"Besides--excuse me--I don't know that"
47,051-075,8,006-008,"'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman"
40,026-050,6,006-008,"'It's not my business,' Scrooge returned"
95,076-010,17,016-020,"'It's enough for a man to understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's"
27,026-050,4,003-005,"Mine occupies me constantly"
25,026-050,3,003-005,"Good afternoon, gentlemen"
85,076-010,14,011-015,"Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentlemen withdrew"
119,101-125,21,021-025,"Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him"
176,176-200,29,026-030,"Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct them on their way"
292,more,52,051-055,"The ancient tower of a church, whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"The cold became intense"
264,251-275,48,046-050,"In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier, round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture"
106,101-125,15,011-015,"The water-plug being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed, and turned to misanthropic ice"
137,126-150,25,021-025,"The brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy as they passed"
188,176-200,32,031-035,"Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do"
399,more,71,more,"The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"Foggier yet, and colder"
32,026-050,4,003-005,"Piercing, searching, biting cold"
190,176-200,35,031-035,"If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose"
199,176-200,38,036-040,"The owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of"
31,026-050,5,003-005,"'God bless you, merry gentleman"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"May nothing you dismay"
145,126-150,26,026-030,"Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost"
60,051-075,10,009-010,"At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived"
174,151-175,31,031-035,"With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out, and put on his hat"
41,051-075,7,006-008,"'You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
25,026-050,4,003-005,"'If quite convenient, sir"
55,051-075,9,009-010,"'It's not convenient,' said Scrooge, 'and it's not fair"
82,076-010,15,011-015,"If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill-used, I'll be bound"
24,026-050,4,003-005,"The clerk smiled faintly"
91,076-010,18,016-020,"'And yet,' said Scrooge, 'you don't think me ill-used, when I pay a day's wages for no work"
47,051-075,10,009-010,"The clerk observed that it was only once a year"
72,076-010,12,011-015,"'A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of December"
50,051-075,8,006-008,"said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin"
42,051-075,9,009-010,"'But I suppose you must have the whole day"
36,026-050,7,006-008,"Be here all the earlier next morning"
69,076-010,13,011-015,"The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl"
350,more,67,more,"The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blindman's-buff"
180,176-200,30,026-030,"Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker's-book, went home to bed"
68,076-010,12,011-015,"He lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner"
279,more,53,051-055,"They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses, and forgotten the way out again"
122,101-125,24,021-025,"It was old enough now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices"
98,076-010,20,016-020,"The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands"
158,151-175,31,031-035,"The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold"
120,101-125,24,021-025,"Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door, except that it was very large"
281,more,51,051-055,"It is also a fact, that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of London, even including--which is a bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery"
152,151-175,28,026-030,"Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley, since his last mention of his seven years' dead partner that afternoon"
228,226-250,42,041-045,"And then let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but Marley's face"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"Marley's face"
141,126-150,29,026-030,"It was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar"
134,126-150,24,021-025,"It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead"
127,126-150,23,021-025,"The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air; and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless"
159,151-175,31,031-035,"That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control, rather than a part of its own expression"
68,076-010,12,011-015,"As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again"
154,151-175,30,026-030,"To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue"
107,101-125,20,016-020,"But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle"
213,201-225,39,036-040,"He did pause, with a moment's irresolution, before he shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the hall"
122,101-125,25,021-025,"But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said 'Pooh, pooh"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"and closed it with a bang"
50,051-075,8,006-008,"The sound resounded through the house like thunder"
124,101-125,22,021-025,"Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own"
48,051-075,10,009-010,"Scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes"
111,101-125,21,021-025,"He fastened the door, and walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too: trimming his candle as he went"
307,more,57,056-060,"You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall and the door towards the balustrades: and done it easy"
162,151-175,31,031-035,"There was plenty of width for that, and room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom"
144,126-150,25,021-025,"Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip"
45,051-075,9,009-010,"Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that"
39,026-050,7,006-008,"Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it"
88,076-010,18,016-020,"But before he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms to see that all was right"
64,076-010,13,011-015,"He had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that"
34,026-050,3,003-005,"Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room"
21,011-025,5,003-005,"All as they should be"
175,151-175,34,031-035,"Nobody under the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his head) upon the hob"
135,126-150,23,021-025,"Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall"
20,011-025,3,003-005,"Lumber-room as usual"
85,076-010,13,011-015,"Old fire-guard, old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker"
110,101-125,18,016-020,"Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his custom"
158,151-175,28,026-030,"Thus secured against surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel"
61,051-075,13,011-015,"It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night"
135,126-150,27,026-030,"He was obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel"
151,151-175,26,026-030,"The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures"
364,more,56,056-060,"There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters; Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod, and swallowed up the whole"
204,201-225,39,036-040,"If each smooth tile had been a blank at first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of old Marley's head on every one"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"'Humbug"
40,026-050,7,006-008,"said Scrooge; and walked across the room"
38,026-050,7,006-008,"After several turns, he sat down again"
219,201-225,42,041-045,"As he threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building"
122,101-125,22,021-025,"It was with great astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he saw this bell begin to swing"
127,126-150,27,026-030,"It swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house"
72,076-010,15,011-015,"This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an hour"
44,051-075,8,006-008,"The bells ceased as they had begun, together"
148,126-150,26,026-030,"They were succeeded by a clanking noise, deep down below; as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant's cellar"
101,101-125,16,016-020,"Scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains"
174,151-175,31,031-035,"The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight towards his door"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"'It's humbug still"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"'I won't believe it"
125,101-125,23,021-025,"His colour changed though, when, without a pause, it came on through the heavy door, and passed into the room before his eyes"
94,076-010,18,016-020,"Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, 'I know him; Marley's Ghost"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"and fell again"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"The same face: the very same"
160,151-175,27,026-030,"Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head"
46,051-075,9,009-010,"The chain he drew was clasped about his middle"
176,176-200,31,031-035,"It was long, and wound about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel"
137,126-150,23,021-025,"His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind"
97,076-010,19,016-020,"Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had never believed it until now"
34,026-050,8,006-008,"No, nor did he believe it even now"
323,more,55,051-055,"Though he looked the phantom through and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before; he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"'How now"
38,026-050,7,006-008,"said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"'What do you want with me"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"'Much"
35,026-050,6,006-008,"--Marley's voice, no doubt about it"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"'Who are you"
17,011-025,5,003-005,"'Ask me who I was"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"'Who were you then"
31,026-050,5,003-005,"said Scrooge, raising his voice"
31,026-050,5,003-005,"'You're particular, for a shade"
75,076-010,14,011-015,"He was going to say 'to a shade,' but substituted this, as more appropriate"
41,051-075,8,006-008,"'In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"'Can you--can you sit down"
40,026-050,6,006-008,"asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him"
6,000-010,2,000-002,"'I can"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"'Do it, then"
246,226-250,42,041-045,"Scrooge asked the question, because he didn't know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation"
92,076-010,20,016-020,"But the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it"
45,051-075,8,006-008,"'You don't believe in me,' observed the Ghost"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"'I don't,' said Scrooge"
70,076-010,13,011-015,"'What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your senses"
28,026-050,5,003-005,"'I don't know,' said Scrooge"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"'Why do you doubt your senses"
53,051-075,8,006-008,"'Because,' said Scrooge, 'a little thing affects them"
50,051-075,9,009-010,"A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats"
109,101-125,22,021-025,"You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato"
63,076-010,12,011-015,"There's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are"
109,101-125,22,021-025,"Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means waggish then"
177,176-200,33,031-035,"The truth is, that he tried to be smart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his terror; for the spectre's voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones"
118,101-125,22,021-025,"To sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him"
107,101-125,18,016-020,"There was something very awful, too, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own"
201,201-225,36,036-040,"Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts, and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"'You see this toothpick"
170,151-175,29,026-030,"said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a second, to divert the vision's stony gaze from himself"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"'I do,' replied the Ghost"
41,051-075,8,006-008,"'You are not looking at it,' said Scrooge"
48,051-075,8,006-008,"'But I see it,' said the Ghost, 'notwithstanding"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"'Well"
135,126-150,27,026-030,"returned Scrooge, 'I have but to swallow this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own creation"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"Humbug, I tell you"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"humbug"
183,176-200,35,031-035,"At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself from falling in a swoon"
175,151-175,34,031-035,"But how much greater was his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast"
66,076-010,12,011-015,"Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"'Mercy"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"he said"
43,051-075,7,006-008,"'Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"'Man of the worldly mind"
47,051-075,10,009-010,"replied the Ghost, 'do you believe in me or not"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"'I do,' said Scrooge"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"'I must"
61,051-075,14,011-015,"But why do spirits walk the earth, and why do they come to me"
223,201-225,42,041-045,"'It is required of every man,' the Ghost returned, 'that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death"
55,051-075,11,011-015,"It is doomed to wander through the world--oh, woe is me"
91,076-010,16,016-020,"--and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to happiness"
79,076-010,15,011-015,"Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands"
43,051-075,6,006-008,"'You are fettered,' said Scrooge, trembling"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"'Tell me why"
54,051-075,11,011-015,"'I wear the chain I forged in life,' replied the Ghost"
112,101-125,28,026-030,"'I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"Is its pattern strange to you"
30,026-050,5,003-005,"Scrooge trembled more and more"
99,076-010,18,016-020,"'Or would you know,' pursued the Ghost, 'the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself"
66,076-010,14,011-015,"It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"You have laboured on it, since"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"It is a ponderous chain"
159,151-175,28,026-030,"Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see nothing"
29,026-050,4,003-005,"'Jacob,' he said, imploringly"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"'Old Jacob Marley, tell me more"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"Speak comfort to me, Jacob"
40,026-050,8,006-008,"'I have none to give,' the Ghost replied"
105,101-125,18,016-020,"'It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of men"
31,026-050,8,006-008,"Nor can I tell you what I would"
41,051-075,9,009-010,"A very little more is all permitted to me"
54,051-075,10,009-010,"I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere"
57,051-075,8,006-008,"My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house--mark me"
117,101-125,20,016-020,"--in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me"
100,076-010,18,016-020,"It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets"
110,101-125,22,021-025,"Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees"
127,126-150,20,016-020,"'You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,' Scrooge observed, in a business-like manner, though with humility and deference"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"'Slow"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"the Ghost repeated"
33,026-050,5,003-005,"'Seven years dead,' mused Scrooge"
28,026-050,5,003-005,"'And travelling all the time"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"'The whole time,' said the Ghost"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"'No rest, no peace"
28,026-050,4,003-005,"Incessant torture of remorse"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"'You travel fast"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
45,051-075,9,009-010,"'On the wings of the wind,' replied the Ghost"
81,076-010,15,011-015,"'You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,' said Scrooge"
187,176-200,35,031-035,"The Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"'Oh"
220,201-225,36,036-040,"captive, bound, and double-ironed,' cried the phantom, 'not to know, that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed"
163,151-175,30,026-030,"Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness"
86,076-010,16,016-020,"Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life's opportunity misused"
14,011-025,4,003-005,"Yet such was I"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Oh"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"such was I"
109,101-125,20,016-020,"'But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,' faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this to himself"
9,011-025,1,000-002,"'Business"
41,051-075,7,006-008,"cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again"
24,026-050,4,003-005,"'Mankind was my business"
104,101-125,15,011-015,"The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business"
91,076-010,18,016-020,"The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business"
135,126-150,27,026-030,"It held up its chain at arm's length, as if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again"
68,076-010,13,011-015,"'At this time of the rolling year,' the spectre said, 'I suffer most"
153,151-175,30,026-030,"Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode"
67,076-010,13,011-015,"Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me"
104,101-125,19,016-020,"Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake exceedingly"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"'Hear me"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"cried the Ghost"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"'My time is nearly gone"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"'I will,' said Scrooge"
26,026-050,6,006-008,"'But don't be hard upon me"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"Don't be flowery, Jacob"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"Pray"
79,076-010,19,016-020,"'How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may not tell"
51,051-075,11,011-015,"I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"It was not an agreeable idea"
58,051-075,9,009-010,"Scrooge shivered, and wiped the perspiration from his brow"
56,051-075,11,011-015,"'That is no light part of my penance,' pursued the Ghost"
88,076-010,19,016-020,"'I am here to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate"
43,051-075,8,006-008,"A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer"
51,051-075,10,009-010,"'You were always a good friend to me,' said Scrooge"
9,011-025,1,000-002,"'Thank'ee"
59,051-075,10,009-010,"'You will be haunted,' resumed the Ghost, 'by Three Spirits"
64,076-010,11,011-015,"Scrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost's had done"
49,051-075,9,009-010,"'Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob"
33,026-050,6,006-008,"he demanded, in a faltering voice"
6,000-010,2,000-002,"'It is"
41,051-075,7,006-008,"'I--I think I'd rather not,' said Scrooge"
81,076-010,15,011-015,"'Without their visits,' said the Ghost, 'you cannot hope to shun the path I tread"
51,051-075,9,009-010,"Expect the first to-morrow, when the bell tolls One"
57,051-075,12,011-015,"'Couldn't I take 'em all at once, and have it over, Jacob"
14,011-025,2,000-002,"hinted Scrooge"
53,051-075,11,011-015,"'Expect the second on the next night at the same hour"
82,076-010,16,016-020,"The third upon the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate"
97,076-010,20,016-020,"Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember what has passed between us"
113,101-125,22,021-025,"When it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the table, and bound it round its head, as before"
104,101-125,19,016-020,"Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its teeth made, when the jaws were brought together by the bandage"
153,151-175,27,026-030,"He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and about its arm"
156,151-175,29,026-030,"The apparition walked backward from him; and at every step it took, the window raised itself a little, so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open"
45,051-075,8,006-008,"It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did"
109,101-125,21,021-025,"When they were within two paces of each other, Marley's Ghost held up its hand, warning him to come no nearer"
15,011-025,2,000-002,"Scrooge stopped"
230,226-250,37,036-040,"Not so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear: for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory"
115,101-125,20,016-020,"The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark night"
58,051-075,9,009-010,"Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"He looked out"
106,101-125,18,016-020,"The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they went"
131,126-150,22,021-025,"Every one of them wore chains like Marley's Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free"
56,051-075,10,009-010,"Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives"
233,226-250,43,041-045,"He had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below, upon a door-step"
129,126-150,24,021-025,"The misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and had lost the power for ever"
83,076-010,14,011-015,"Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he could not tell"
104,101-125,20,016-020,"But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the night became as it had been when he walked home"
79,076-010,14,011-015,"Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had entered"
92,076-010,17,016-020,"It was double-locked, as he had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts were undisturbed"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"He tried to say 'Humbug"
33,026-050,6,006-008,"but stopped at the first syllable"
279,more,51,051-055,"And being, from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in need of repose; went straight to bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the instant"
150,126-150,26,026-030,"WHEN Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed, he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber"
130,126-150,22,021-025,"He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"So he listened for the hour"
133,126-150,25,021-025,"To his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Twelve"
35,026-050,9,009-010,"It was past two when he went to bed"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"The clock was wrong"
38,026-050,8,006-008,"An icicle must have got into the works"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Twelve"
78,076-010,13,011-015,"He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous clock"
47,051-075,8,006-008,"Its rapid little pulse beat twelve: and stopped"
109,101-125,20,016-020,"'Why, it isn't possible,' said Scrooge, 'that I can have slept through a whole day and far into another night"
83,076-010,16,016-020,"It isn't possible that anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon"
89,076-010,18,016-020,"The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his way to the window"
133,126-150,25,021-025,"He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very little then"
268,251-275,51,051-055,"All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world"
92,076-010,18,016-020,"This was a great relief, because 'three days after sight of this First of Exchange pay to Mr"
128,126-150,24,021-025,"Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,' and so forth, would have become a mere United States' security if there were no days to count by"
120,101-125,23,021-025,"Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it"
109,101-125,21,021-025,"The more he thought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he thought"
39,026-050,5,003-005,"Marley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly"
245,226-250,45,041-045,"Every time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through, 'Was it a dream or not"
175,151-175,33,031-035,"Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one"
173,151-175,33,031-035,"He resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power"
127,126-150,24,021-025,"The quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock"
41,051-075,8,006-008,"At length it broke upon his listening ear"
11,011-025,2,000-002,"'Ding, dong"
40,026-050,6,006-008,"'A quarter past,' said Scrooge, counting"
11,011-025,2,000-002,"'Ding, dong"
10,011-025,1,000-002,"'Half-past"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
11,011-025,2,000-002,"'Ding, dong"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"'A quarter to it,' said Scrooge"
11,011-025,2,000-002,"'Ding, dong"
64,076-010,9,009-010,"'The hour itself,' said Scrooge, triumphantly, 'and nothing else"
97,076-010,18,016-020,"He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep, dull, hollow, melancholy ONE"
85,076-010,17,016-020,"Light flashed up in the room upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn"
63,076-010,14,011-015,"The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand"
101,101-125,20,016-020,"Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to which his face was addressed"
248,226-250,48,046-050,"The curtains of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow"
232,226-250,41,041-045,"It was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so like a child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view, and being diminished to a child's proportions"
162,151-175,35,031-035,"Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin"
98,076-010,19,016-020,"The arms were very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength"
79,076-010,13,011-015,"Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper members, bare"
116,101-125,23,021-025,"It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful"
146,126-150,26,026-030,"It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers"
280,more,54,051-055,"But the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm"
102,101-125,16,016-020,"Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness, was not its strangest quality"
418,more,80,more,"For as its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another, and what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away"
84,076-010,17,016-020,"And in the very wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and clear as ever"
57,051-075,11,011-015,"'Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"asked Scrooge"
5,000-010,2,000-002,"'I am"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"The voice was soft and gentle"
81,076-010,16,016-020,"Singularly low, as if instead of being so close beside him, it were at a distance"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"'Who, and what are you"
16,011-025,2,000-002,"Scrooge demanded"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"'I am the Ghost of Christmas Past"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"'Long Past"
51,051-075,7,006-008,"inquired Scrooge: observant of its dwarfish stature"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"'No"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"Your past"
169,151-175,33,031-035,"Perhaps, Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if anybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire to see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"'What"
85,076-010,16,016-020,"exclaimed the Ghost, 'would you so soon put out, with worldly hands, the light I give"
143,126-150,30,026-030,"Is it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow"
137,126-150,22,021-025,"Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge of having wilfully 'bonneted' the Spirit at any period of his life"
60,051-075,11,011-015,"He then made bold to inquire what business brought him there"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"'Your welfare"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"said the Ghost"
140,126-150,24,021-025,"Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end"
65,076-010,11,011-015,"The Spirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately:"
23,026-050,3,003-005,"'Your reclamation, then"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"Take heed"
73,076-010,16,016-020,"It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the arm"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"'Rise"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"and walk with me"
304,more,57,056-060,"It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at that time"
66,076-010,13,011-015,"The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand, was not to be resisted"
94,076-010,16,016-020,"He rose: but finding that the Spirit made towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication"
58,051-075,10,009-010,"'I am a mortal,' Scrooge remonstrated, 'and liable to fall"
122,101-125,25,021-025,"'Bear but a touch of my hand there,' said the Spirit, laying it upon his heart, 'and you shall be upheld in more than this"
119,101-125,22,021-025,"As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either hand"
30,026-050,5,003-005,"The city had entirely vanished"
34,026-050,9,009-010,"Not a vestige of it was to be seen"
111,101-125,22,021-025,"The darkness and the mist had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon the ground"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"'Good Heaven"
65,076-010,11,011-015,"said Scrooge, clasping his hands together, as he looked about him"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"'I was bred in this place"
16,011-025,5,003-005,"I was a boy here"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"The Spirit gazed upon him mildly"
118,101-125,20,016-020,"Its gentle touch, though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man's sense of feeling"
156,151-175,27,026-030,"He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares long, long, forgotten"
39,026-050,7,006-008,"'Your lip is trembling,' said the Ghost"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"'And what is that upon your cheek"
126,126-150,24,021-025,"Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"'You recollect the way"
19,011-025,3,003-005,"inquired the Spirit"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"'Remember it"
54,051-075,9,009-010,"cried Scrooge with fervour; 'I could walk it blindfold"
47,051-075,9,009-010,"'Strange to have forgotten it for so many years"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"observed the Ghost"
13,011-025,4,003-005,"'Let us go on"
179,176-200,29,026-030,"They walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river"
152,151-175,27,026-030,"Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers"
154,151-175,30,026-030,"All these boys were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the broad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it"
68,076-010,13,011-015,"'These are but shadows of the things that have been,' said the Ghost"
33,026-050,6,006-008,"'They have no consciousness of us"
86,076-010,16,016-020,"The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named them every one"
49,051-075,10,009-010,"Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them"
69,076-010,15,011-015,"Why did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past"
151,151-175,26,026-030,"Why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for their several homes"
35,026-050,6,006-008,"What was merry Christmas to Scrooge"
24,026-050,4,003-005,"Out upon merry Christmas"
33,026-050,8,006-008,"What good had it ever done to him"
50,051-075,9,009-010,"'The school is not quite deserted,' said the Ghost"
64,076-010,11,011-015,"'A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"Scrooge said he knew it"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"And he sobbed"
183,176-200,31,031-035,"They left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little weathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell hanging in it"
171,151-175,30,026-030,"It was a large house, but one of broken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed"
98,076-010,16,016-020,"Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass"
185,176-200,32,031-035,"Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and vast"
168,151-175,31,031-035,"There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candle-light, and not too much to eat"
85,076-010,18,016-020,"They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back of the house"
123,101-125,22,021-025,"It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks"
151,151-175,33,031-035,"At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be"
409,more,76,more,"Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears"
91,076-010,17,016-020,"The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self, intent upon his reading"
184,176-200,34,031-035,"Suddenly a man, in foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at: stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"'Why, it's Ali Baba"
28,026-050,4,003-005,"Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"'It's dear old honest Ali Baba"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"Yes, yes, I know"
119,101-125,22,021-025,"One Christmas time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone, he did come, for the first time, just like that"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"Poor boy"
73,076-010,12,011-015,"And Valentine,' said Scrooge, 'and his wild brother, Orson; there they go"
104,101-125,21,021-025,"And what's his name, who was put down in his drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don't you see him"
81,076-010,16,016-020,"And the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon his head"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"Serve him right"
14,011-025,4,003-005,"I'm glad of it"
50,051-075,10,009-010,"What business had he to be married to the Princess"
251,251-275,43,041-045,"To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city, indeed"
19,011-025,3,003-005,"'There's the Parrot"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"cried Scrooge"
104,101-125,22,021-025,"'Green body and yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is"
88,076-010,16,016-020,"Poor Robin Crusoe, he called him, when he came home again after sailing round the island"
53,051-075,9,009-010,"'Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin Crusoe"
48,051-075,10,009-010,"' The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"It was the Parrot, you know"
59,051-075,11,011-015,"There goes Friday, running for his life to the little creek"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Halloa"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"Hoop"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Halloo"
120,101-125,22,021-025,"Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, 'Poor boy"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"and cried again"
142,126-150,26,026-030,"'I wish,' Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his cuff: 'but it's too late now"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"'What is the matter"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"asked the Spirit"
23,026-050,3,003-005,"'Nothing,' said Scrooge"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"'Nothing"
63,076-010,13,011-015,"There was a boy singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night"
53,051-075,10,009-010,"I should like to have given him something: that's all"
101,101-125,18,016-020,"The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand: saying as it did so, 'Let us see another Christmas"
98,076-010,18,016-020,"Scrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a little darker and more dirty"
194,176-200,35,031-035,"The panels shrunk, the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how all this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than you do"
165,151-175,31,031-035,"He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays"
60,051-075,11,011-015,"He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly"
104,101-125,18,016-020,"Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced anxiously towards the door"
174,151-175,32,031-035,"It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him, addressed him as her 'Dear, dear brother"
44,051-075,9,009-010,"'I have come to bring you home, dear brother"
66,076-010,12,011-015,"said the child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"'To bring you home, home, home"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"'Home, little Fan"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"returned the boy"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"'Yes"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"said the child, brimful of glee"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"'Home, for good and all"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"Home, for ever and ever"
68,076-010,14,011-015,"Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home's like Heaven"
196,176-200,45,041-045,"He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you"
22,026-050,6,006-008,"And you're to be a man"
167,151-175,32,031-035,"said the child, opening her eyes, 'and are never to come back here; but first, we're to be together all the Christmas long, and have the merriest time in all the world"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"'You are quite a woman, little Fan"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"exclaimed the boy"
135,126-150,25,021-025,"She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him"
116,101-125,21,021-025,"Then she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to go, accompanied her"
75,076-010,13,011-015,"A terrible voice in the hall cried, 'Bring down Master Scrooge's box, there"
181,176-200,31,031-035,"and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him"
216,201-225,39,036-040,"He then conveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold"
366,more,67,more,"Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people: at the same time, sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of 'something' to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman, but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not"
295,more,50,046-050,"Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove gaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray"
79,076-010,13,011-015,"'Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,' said the Ghost"
26,026-050,6,006-008,"'But she had a large heart"
27,026-050,5,003-005,"'So she had,' cried Scrooge"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"'You're right"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"I will not gainsay it, Spirit"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"God forbid"
66,076-010,13,011-015,"'She died a woman,' said the Ghost, 'and had, as I think, children"
29,026-050,4,003-005,"'One child,' Scrooge returned"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"'True,' said the Ghost"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"'Your nephew"
61,051-075,10,009-010,"Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly, 'Yes"
262,251-275,47,046-050,"Although they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and tumult of a real city were"
150,126-150,29,026-030,"It was made plain enough, by the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas time again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up"
78,076-010,15,011-015,"The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he knew it"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"'Know it"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"'Was I apprenticed here"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"They went in"
201,201-225,38,036-040,"At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"'Why, it's old Fezziwig"
42,051-075,7,006-008,"Bless his heart; it's Fezziwig alive again"
94,076-010,19,016-020,"Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which pointed to the hour of seven"
188,176-200,31,031-035,"He rubbed his hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"'Yo ho, there"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Ebenezer"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"Dick"
98,076-010,15,011-015,"Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in, accompanied by his fellow-'prentice"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"'Dick Wilkins, to be sure"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"said Scrooge to the Ghost"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"'Bless me, yes"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"There he is"
41,051-075,9,009-010,"He was very much attached to me, was Dick"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"Poor Dick"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"Dear, dear"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"'Yo ho, my boys"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"said Fezziwig"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"'No more work to-night"
19,011-025,3,003-005,"Christmas Eve, Dick"
19,011-025,2,000-002,"Christmas, Ebenezer"
116,101-125,22,021-025,"Let's have the shutters up,' cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap of his hands, 'before a man can say Jack Robinson"
53,051-075,10,009-010,"You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it"
232,226-250,35,031-035,"They charged into the street with the shutters--one, two, three--had 'em up in their places--four, five, six--barred 'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight, nine--and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses"
9,011-025,1,000-002,"'Hilli-ho"
76,076-010,12,011-015,"cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk, with wonderful agility"
54,051-075,11,011-015,"'Clear away, my lads, and let's have lots of room here"
14,011-025,2,000-002,"Hilli-ho, Dick"
17,011-025,2,000-002,"Chirrup, Ebenezer"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"Clear away"
110,101-125,18,016-020,"There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared away, or couldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking on"
23,026-050,6,006-008,"It was done in a minute"
295,more,55,051-055,"Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter's night"
131,126-150,25,021-025,"In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"In came Mrs"
36,026-050,5,003-005,"Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile"
53,051-075,9,009-010,"In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable"
55,051-075,10,009-010,"In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke"
60,051-075,12,011-015,"In came all the young men and women employed in the business"
49,051-075,9,009-010,"In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the baker"
67,076-010,11,011-015,"In came the cook, with her brother's particular friend, the milkman"
218,201-225,43,041-045,"In came the boy from over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress"
160,151-175,26,026-030,"In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, anyhow and everyhow"
353,more,67,more,"Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them"
109,101-125,19,016-020,"When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his hands to stop the dance, cried out, 'Well done"
95,076-010,17,016-020,"and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially provided for that purpose"
245,226-250,44,041-045,"But scorning rest, upon his reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home, exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish"
239,226-250,45,041-045,"There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer"
106,101-125,20,016-020,"But the great effect of the evening came after the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind"
81,076-010,18,016-020,"The sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told it him"
34,026-050,7,006-008,") struck up 'Sir Roger de Coverley"
45,051-075,9,009-010,"Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Fezziwig"
202,201-225,40,036-040,"Top couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no notion of walking"
115,101-125,22,021-025,"But if they had been twice as many--ah, four times--old Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would Mrs"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Fezziwig"
70,076-010,16,016-020,"As to her, she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term"
58,051-075,12,011-015,"If that's not high praise, tell me higher, and I'll use it"
57,051-075,9,009-010,"A positive light appeared to issue from Fezziwig's calves"
48,051-075,10,009-010,"They shone in every part of the dance like moons"
83,076-010,15,011-015,"You couldn't have predicted, at any given time, what would have become of them next"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"And when old Fezziwig and Mrs"
283,more,47,046-050,"Fezziwig had gone all through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to your place; Fezziwig 'cut'--cut so deftly, that he appeared to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger"
57,051-075,10,009-010,"When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Mr"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"and Mrs"
169,151-175,31,031-035,"Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas"
199,176-200,37,036-040,"When everybody had retired but the two 'prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away, and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter in the back-shop"
75,076-010,16,016-020,"During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits"
62,076-010,13,011-015,"His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self"
108,101-125,12,011-015,"He corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent the strangest agitation"
227,226-250,43,041-045,"It was not until now, when the bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its head burnt very clear"
81,076-010,15,011-015,"'A small matter,' said the Ghost, 'to make these silly folks so full of gratitude"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"'Small"
14,011-025,2,000-002,"echoed Scrooge"
146,126-150,28,026-030,"The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig: and when he had done so, said,"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"'Why"
9,011-025,3,003-005,"Is it not"
73,076-010,15,011-015,"He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money: three or four perhaps"
44,051-075,9,009-010,"Is that so much that he deserves this praise"
117,101-125,19,016-020,"'It isn't that,' said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"'It isn't that, Spirit"
109,101-125,22,021-025,"He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil"
138,126-150,27,026-030,"Say that his power lies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count 'em up: what then"
65,076-010,14,011-015,"The happiness he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune"
40,026-050,7,006-008,"He felt the Spirit's glance, and stopped"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"'What is the matter"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"asked the Ghost"
34,026-050,4,003-005,"'Nothing particular,' said Scrooge"
19,011-025,3,003-005,"'Something, I think"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"the Ghost insisted"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"'No,' said Scrooge, 'No"
66,076-010,17,016-020,"I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"That's all"
138,126-150,28,026-030,"His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air"
42,051-075,7,006-008,"'My time grows short,' observed the Spirit"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"'Quick"
103,101-125,20,016-020,"This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but it produced an immediate effect"
29,026-050,5,003-005,"For again Scrooge saw himself"
44,051-075,11,011-015,"He was older now; a man in the prime of life"
113,101-125,24,021-025,"His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice"
153,151-175,28,026-030,"There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall"
185,176-200,37,036-040,"He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past"
37,026-050,6,006-008,"'It matters little,' she said, softly"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"'To you, very little"
143,126-150,31,031-035,"Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve"
28,026-050,5,003-005,"'What Idol has displaced you"
11,011-025,2,000-002,"he rejoined"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"'A golden one"
45,051-075,8,006-008,"'This is the even-handed dealing of the world"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"he said"
141,126-150,27,026-030,"'There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth"
51,051-075,9,009-010,"'You fear the world too much,' she answered, gently"
97,076-010,18,016-020,"'All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid reproach"
102,101-125,17,016-020,"I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"Have I not"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"'What then"
11,011-025,2,000-002,"he retorted"
46,051-075,10,009-010,"'Even if I have grown so much wiser, what then"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"I am not changed towards you"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"She shook her head"
5,000-010,2,000-002,"'Am I"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"'Our contract is an old one"
140,126-150,27,026-030,"It was made when we were both poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"You are changed"
38,026-050,8,006-008,"When it was made, you were another man"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"'I was a boy,' he said impatiently"
73,076-010,14,011-015,"'Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,' she returned"
5,000-010,2,000-002,"'I am"
99,076-010,19,016-020,"That which promised happiness when we were one in heart, is fraught with misery now that we are two"
63,076-010,14,011-015,"How often and how keenly I have thought of this, I will not say"
59,051-075,13,011-015,"It is enough that I have thought of it, and can release you"
27,026-050,5,003-005,"'Have I ever sought release"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"'In words"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"No"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"Never"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"'In what, then"
104,101-125,19,016-020,"'In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end"
67,076-010,14,011-015,"In everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight"
151,151-175,30,026-030,"If this had never been between us,' said the girl, looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; 'tell me, would you seek me out and try to win me now"
6,000-010,2,000-002,"Ah, no"
74,076-010,14,011-015,"He seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in spite of himself"
43,051-075,9,009-010,"But he said with a struggle, 'You think not"
72,076-010,12,011-015,"'I would gladly think otherwise if I could,' she answered, 'Heaven knows"
84,076-010,17,016-020,"When I have learned a Truth like this, I know how strong and irresistible it must be"
340,more,61,more,"But if you were free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless girl--you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow"
23,026-050,6,006-008,"I do; and I release you"
52,051-075,12,011-015,"With a full heart, for the love of him you once were"
69,076-010,14,011-015,"He was about to speak; but with her head turned from him, she resumed"
83,076-010,16,016-020,"'You may--the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will--have pain in this"
146,126-150,26,026-030,"A very, very brief time, and you will dismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an unprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you awoke"
44,051-075,10,009-010,"May you be happy in the life you have chosen"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"She left him, and they parted"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"'Spirit"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"said Scrooge, 'show me no more"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"Conduct me home"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"Why do you delight to torture me"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"'One shadow more"
19,011-025,3,003-005,"exclaimed the Ghost"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"'No more"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"cried Scrooge"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"'No more"
22,026-050,6,006-008,"I don't wish to see it"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"Show me no more"
100,076-010,18,016-020,"But the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him to observe what happened next"
93,076-010,18,016-020,"They were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or handsome, but full of comfort"
177,176-200,33,031-035,"Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter"
295,more,49,046-050,"The noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count; and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty children conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting itself like forty"
266,251-275,44,041-045,"The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care; on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily, and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly"
45,051-075,11,011-015,"What would I not have given to be one of them"
46,051-075,10,009-010,"Though I never could have been so rude, no, no"
176,176-200,34,031-035,"I wouldn't for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"to save my life"
192,176-200,37,036-040,"As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold young brood, I couldn't have done it; I should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again"
428,more,85,more,"And yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value"
296,more,55,051-055,"But now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys and presents"
95,076-010,16,016-020,"Then the shouting and the struggling, and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter"
216,201-225,38,036-040,"The scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection"
89,076-010,15,011-015,"The shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received"
207,201-225,36,036-040,"The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll's frying-pan into his mouth, and was more than suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter"
48,051-075,9,009-010,"The immense relief of finding this a false alarm"
35,026-050,6,006-008,"The joy, and gratitude, and ecstasy"
32,026-050,5,003-005,"They are all indescribable alike"
180,176-200,38,036-040,"It is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour, and by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house; where they went to bed, and so subsided"
389,more,71,more,"And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of the house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such another creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have called him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed"
105,101-125,20,016-020,"'Belle,' said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, 'I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"'Who was it"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"'Guess"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"'How can I"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"Tut, don't I know"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"she added in the same breath, laughing as he laughed"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"'Mr"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"Scrooge"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"'Mr"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"Scrooge it was"
115,101-125,24,021-025,"I passed his office window; and as it was not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him"
72,076-010,15,011-015,"His partner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone"
38,026-050,8,006-008,"Quite alone in the world, I do believe"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"'Spirit"
58,051-075,11,011-015,"said Scrooge in a broken voice, 'remove me from this place"
76,076-010,15,011-015,"'I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,' said the Ghost"
45,051-075,10,009-010,"'That they are what they are, do not blame me"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"'Remove me"
36,026-050,6,006-008,"Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it"
175,151-175,35,031-035,"He turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a face, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"'Leave me"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"Take me back"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"Haunt me no longer"
360,more,64,more,"In the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized the extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head"
230,226-250,41,041-045,"The Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he could not hide the light: which streamed from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground"
122,101-125,20,016-020,"He was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own bedroom"
131,126-150,27,026-030,"He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep"
186,176-200,36,036-040,"AWAKING in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of One"
201,201-225,33,031-035,"He felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to him through Jacob Marley's intervention"
242,226-250,44,041-045,"But finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own hands; and lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the bed"
129,126-150,25,021-025,"For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise, and made nervous"
385,more,60,056-060,"Gentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being acquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time-of-day, express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects"
242,226-250,43,041-045,"Without venturing for Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much"
199,176-200,35,031-035,"Now, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the Bell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of trembling"
73,076-010,14,011-015,"Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came"
437,more,80,more,"All this time, he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of knowing it"
387,more,74,more,"At last, however, he began to think--as you or I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would unquestionably have done it too--at last, I say, he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine"
103,101-125,20,016-020,"This idea taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled in his slippers to the door"
101,101-125,20,016-020,"The moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock, a strange voice called him by his name, and bade him enter"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"He obeyed"
19,011-025,5,003-005,"It was his own room"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"There was no doubt about that"
48,051-075,7,006-008,"But it had undergone a surprising transformation"
145,126-150,25,021-025,"The walls and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which, bright gleaming berries glistened"
308,more,56,056-060,"The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time, or Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone"
379,more,55,051-055,"Heaped up on the floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages, mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam"
222,201-225,44,041-045,"In easy state upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge, as he came peeping round the door"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"'Come in"
19,011-025,3,003-005,"exclaimed the Ghost"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"'Come in"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"and know me better, man"
61,051-075,10,009-010,"Scrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit"
121,101-125,25,021-025,"He was not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were clear and kind, he did not like to meet them"
54,051-075,10,009-010,"'I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,' said the Spirit"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"'Look upon me"
25,026-050,4,003-005,"Scrooge reverently did so"
75,076-010,14,011-015,"It was clothed in one simple green robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur"
138,126-150,25,021-025,"This garment hung so loosely on the figure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice"
179,176-200,33,031-035,"Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining icicles"
165,151-175,29,026-030,"Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its genial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air"
118,101-125,23,021-025,"Girded round its middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust"
42,051-075,9,009-010,"'You have never seen the like of me before"
20,011-025,3,003-005,"exclaimed the Spirit"
34,026-050,6,006-008,"'Never,' Scrooge made answer to it"
137,126-150,25,021-025,"'Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning (for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years"
19,011-025,3,003-005,"pursued the Phantom"
36,026-050,7,006-008,"'I don't think I have,' said Scrooge"
23,026-050,6,006-008,"'I am afraid I have not"
34,026-050,6,006-008,"Have you had many brothers, Spirit"
44,051-075,7,006-008,"'More than eighteen hundred,' said the Ghost"
35,026-050,6,006-008,"'A tremendous family to provide for"
16,011-025,2,000-002,"muttered Scrooge"
35,026-050,6,006-008,"The Ghost of Christmas Present rose"
63,076-010,9,009-010,"'Spirit,' said Scrooge submissively, 'conduct me where you will"
81,076-010,16,016-020,"I went forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt a lesson which is working now"
60,051-075,13,011-015,"To-night, if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"'Touch my robe"
44,051-075,10,009-010,"Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast"
161,151-175,22,021-025,"Holly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch, all vanished instantly"
462,more,85,more,"So did the room, the fire, the ruddy glow, the hour of night, and they stood in the city streets on Christmas morning, where (for the weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk and not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the pavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of their houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the road below, and splitting into artificial little snow-storms"
451,more,78,more,"The house fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker, contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground; which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows that crossed and re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great streets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water"
292,more,52,051-055,"The sky was gloomy, and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist, half thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were blazing away to their dear hearts' content"
203,201-225,36,036-040,"There was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain"
309,more,53,051-055,"For, the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious snowball--better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest-- laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it went wrong"
91,076-010,15,011-015,"The poulterers' shops were still half open, and the fruiterers' were radiant in their glory"
193,176-200,30,026-030,"There were great, round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence"
245,226-250,39,036-040,"There were ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe"
634,more,99,more,"There were pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers' benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people's mouths might water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner"
280,more,49,046-050,"The very gold and silver fish, set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"The Grocers'"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"oh, the Grocers'"
91,076-010,15,011-015,"nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses"
572,more,102,more,"It was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on feel faint and subsequently bilious"
765,more,135,more,"Nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own, worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose"
167,151-175,29,026-030,"But soon the steeples called good people all, to church and chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes, and with their gayest faces"
156,151-175,24,021-025,"And at the same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners to the bakers' shops"
236,226-250,41,041-045,"The sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with Scrooge beside him in a baker's doorway, and taking off the covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch"
234,226-250,44,041-045,"And it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice when there were angry words between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good humour was restored directly"
59,051-075,12,011-015,"For they said, it was a shame to quarrel upon Christmas Day"
13,011-025,4,003-005,"And so it was"
22,026-050,6,006-008,"God love it, so it was"
266,251-275,50,046-050,"In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker's oven; where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too"
65,076-010,12,011-015,"'Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"asked Scrooge"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"'There is"
6,000-010,2,000-002,"My own"
49,051-075,11,011-015,"'Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"asked Scrooge"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"'To any kindly given"
18,011-025,5,003-005,"To a poor one most"
23,026-050,6,006-008,"'Why to a poor one most"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"asked Scrooge"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"'Because it needs it most"
185,176-200,30,026-030,"'Spirit,' said Scrooge, after a moment's thought, 'I wonder you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these people's opportunities of innocent enjoyment"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"'I"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"cried the Spirit"
142,126-150,28,026-030,"'You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all,' said Scrooge"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"'Wouldn't you"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"'I"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"cried the Spirit"
50,051-075,10,009-010,"'You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"'And it comes to the same thing"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"'I seek"
20,011-025,3,003-005,"exclaimed the Spirit"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"'Forgive me if I am wrong"
80,076-010,17,016-020,"It has been done in your name, or at least in that of your family,' said Scrooge"
272,251-275,52,051-055,"'There are some upon this earth of yours,' returned the Spirit, 'who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived"
60,051-075,10,009-010,"Remember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us"
114,101-125,21,021-025,"Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on, invisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the town"
325,more,57,056-060,"It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the baker's), that notwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall"
416,more,77,more,"And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge's clerk's; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"Think of that"
177,176-200,29,026-030,"Bob had but fifteen 'Bob' a-week himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present blessed his four-roomed house"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"Then up rose Mrs"
575,more,97,more,"Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob's private property, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks"
470,more,81,more,"And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt the goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and peeled"
44,051-075,8,006-008,"'What has ever got your precious father then"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"said Mrs"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Cratchit"
27,026-050,5,003-005,"'And your brother, Tiny Tim"
60,051-075,10,009-010,"And Martha warn't as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour"
22,026-050,3,003-005,"'Here's Martha, mother"
35,026-050,7,006-008,"said a girl, appearing as she spoke"
22,026-050,3,003-005,"'Here's Martha, mother"
29,026-050,5,003-005,"cried the two young Cratchits"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"'Hurrah"
28,026-050,5,003-005,"There's such a goose, Martha"
55,051-075,11,011-015,"'Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"said Mrs"
100,076-010,18,016-020,"Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal"
108,101-125,21,021-025,"'We'd a deal of work to finish up last night,' replied the girl, 'and had to clear away this morning, mother"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"'Well"
45,051-075,10,009-010,"Never mind so long as you are come,' said Mrs"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Cratchit"
69,076-010,15,011-015,"'Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"'No, no"
82,076-010,13,011-015,"There's father coming,' cried the two young Cratchits, who were everywhere at once"
19,011-025,3,003-005,"'Hide, Martha, hide"
247,226-250,43,041-045,"So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder"
88,076-010,18,016-020,"Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame"
24,026-050,4,003-005,"'Why, where's our Martha"
33,026-050,5,003-005,"cried Bob Cratchit, looking round"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"'Not coming,' said Mrs"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Cratchit"
11,011-025,2,000-002,"'Not coming"
140,126-150,27,026-030,"said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits; for he had been Tim's blood horse all the way from church, and had come home rampant"
30,026-050,5,003-005,"'Not coming upon Christmas Day"
287,more,53,051-055,"Martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"'And how did little Tim behave"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"asked Mrs"
107,101-125,19,016-020,"Cratchit, when she had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his heart's content"
40,026-050,8,006-008,"'As good as gold,' said Bob, 'and better"
102,101-125,17,016-020,"Somehow he gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever heard"
209,201-225,41,041-045,"He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind men see"
124,101-125,23,021-025,"Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty"
521,more,94,more,"His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while Bob, turning up his cuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more shabby--compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Peter, and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon returned in high procession"
208,201-225,40,036-040,"Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of course--and in truth it was something very like it in that house"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"Mrs"
484,more,79,more,"Cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped"
50,051-075,11,011-015,"At last the dishes were set on, and grace was said"
46,051-075,9,009-010,"It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs"
342,more,61,more,"Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"There never was such a goose"
61,051-075,12,011-015,"Bob said he didn't believe there ever was such a goose cooked"
87,076-010,13,011-015,"Its tenderness and flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal admiration"
108,101-125,19,016-020,"Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as Mrs"
115,101-125,22,021-025,"Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last"
118,101-125,21,021-025,"Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows"
54,051-075,10,009-010,"But now, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs"
99,076-010,17,016-020,"Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous to bear witnesses--to take the pudding up and bring it in"
36,026-050,7,006-008,"Suppose it should not be done enough"
38,026-050,7,006-008,"Suppose it should break in turning out"
177,176-200,30,026-030,"Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which the two young Cratchits became livid"
34,026-050,6,006-008,"All sorts of horrors were supposed"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"Hallo"
21,011-025,5,003-005,"A great deal of steam"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"The pudding was out of the copper"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"A smell like a washing-day"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"That was the cloth"
109,101-125,20,016-020,"A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to that"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"That was the pudding"
20,011-025,5,003-005,"In half a minute Mrs"
218,201-225,32,031-035,"Cratchit entered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"Oh, a wonderful pudding"
94,076-010,17,016-020,"Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs"
29,026-050,4,003-005,"Cratchit since their marriage"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"Mrs"
120,101-125,23,021-025,"Cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour"
116,101-125,23,021-025,"Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family"
39,026-050,9,009-010,"It would have been flat heresy to do so"
55,051-075,11,011-015,"Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing"
94,076-010,19,016-020,"At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire made up"
148,126-150,26,026-030,"The compound in the jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the fire"
171,151-175,31,031-035,"Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth, in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass"
48,051-075,8,006-008,"Two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle"
194,176-200,35,031-035,"These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"Then Bob proposed:"
38,026-050,8,006-008,"'A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"God bless us"
30,026-050,5,003-005,"Which all the family re-echoed"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"'God bless us every one"
30,026-050,7,006-008,"said Tiny Tim, the last of all"
60,051-075,12,011-015,"He sat very close to his father's side upon his little stool"
147,126-150,31,031-035,"Bob held his withered little hand in his, as if he loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him"
97,076-010,18,016-020,"'Spirit,' said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, 'tell me if Tiny Tim will live"
121,101-125,20,016-020,"'I see a vacant seat,' replied the Ghost, 'in the poor chimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved"
67,076-010,12,011-015,"If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"'No, no,' said Scrooge"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"'Oh, no, kind Spirit"
21,011-025,5,003-005,"say he will be spared"
113,101-125,20,016-020,"'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none other of my race,' returned the Ghost, 'will find him here"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"What then"
78,076-010,16,016-020,"If he be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population"
107,101-125,20,016-020,"Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief"
148,126-150,28,026-030,"'Man,' said the Ghost, 'if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered What the surplus is, and Where it is"
55,051-075,11,011-015,"Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die"
124,101-125,25,021-025,"It may be, that in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man's child"
6,000-010,2,000-002,"Oh God"
101,101-125,20,016-020,"to hear the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust"
83,076-010,14,011-015,"Scrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"But he raised them speedily, on hearing his own name"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"'Mr"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"Scrooge"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"said Bob; 'I'll give you Mr"
33,026-050,6,006-008,"Scrooge, the Founder of the Feast"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"'The Founder of the Feast indeed"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"cried Mrs"
19,011-025,2,000-002,"Cratchit, reddening"
22,026-050,6,006-008,"'I wish I had him here"
90,076-010,21,021-025,"I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he'd have a good appetite for it"
34,026-050,6,006-008,"'My dear,' said Bob, 'the children"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"Christmas Day"
135,126-150,26,026-030,"'It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,' said she, 'on which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"Scrooge"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"You know he is, Robert"
47,051-075,9,009-010,"Nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow"
48,051-075,8,006-008,"'My dear,' was Bob's mild answer, 'Christmas Day"
61,051-075,12,011-015,"'I'll drink his health for your sake and the Day's,' said Mrs"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"Cratchit, 'not for his"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"Long life to him"
38,026-050,8,006-008,"A merry Christmas and a happy new year"
51,051-075,11,011-015,"He'll be very merry and very happy, I have no doubt"
38,026-050,7,006-008,"The children drank the toast after her"
61,051-075,11,011-015,"It was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness"
65,076-010,14,011-015,"Tiny Tim drank it last of all, but he didn't care twopence for it"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"Scrooge was the Ogre of the family"
102,101-125,20,016-020,"The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full five minutes"
126,126-150,23,021-025,"After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with"
139,126-150,24,021-025,"Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly"
297,more,49,046-050,"The two young Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man of business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that bewildering income"
257,251-275,51,051-055,"Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner's, then told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch, and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home"
217,201-225,45,041-045,"Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord 'was much about as tall as Peter;' at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you couldn't have seen his head if you had been there"
214,201-225,41,041-045,"All this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed"
38,026-050,8,006-008,"There was nothing of high mark in this"
210,201-225,36,036-040,"They were not a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside of a pawnbroker's"
264,251-275,46,046-050,"But, they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit's torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last"
212,201-225,37,036-040,"By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms, was wonderful"
203,201-225,36,036-040,"Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness"
162,151-175,29,026-030,"There all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them"
307,more,51,051-055,"Here, again, were shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near neighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them enter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow"
259,251-275,47,046-050,"But, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting company, and piling up its fires half-chimney high"
38,026-050,7,006-008,"Blessings on it, how the Ghost exulted"
177,176-200,30,026-030,"How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach"
255,251-275,43,041-045,"The very lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but Christmas"
361,more,66,more,"And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed, or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass"
215,201-225,41,041-045,"Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"'What place is this"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"asked Scrooge"
87,076-010,16,016-020,"'A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,' returned the Spirit"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"'But they know me"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"See"
76,076-010,15,011-015,"A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced towards it"
103,101-125,18,016-020,"Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire"
158,151-175,26,026-030,"An old, old man and woman, with their children and their children's children, and another generation beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire"
227,226-250,46,046-050,"The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song--it had been a very old song when he was a boy--and from time to time they all joined in the chorus"
130,126-150,25,021-025,"So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank again"
107,101-125,19,016-020,"The Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and passing on above the moor, sped--whither"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"Not to sea"
6,000-010,2,000-002,"To sea"
276,more,50,046-050,"To Scrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth"
167,151-175,30,026-030,"Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse"
174,151-175,31,031-035,"Great heaps of sea-weed clung to its base, and storm-birds --born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the water--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed"
157,151-175,32,031-035,"But even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea"
315,more,61,more,"Joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and one of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship might be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in itself"
148,126-150,28,026-030,"Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea --on, on--until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a ship"
337,more,59,056-060,"They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it"
284,more,56,056-060,"And every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember him"
308,more,57,056-060,"It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear a hearty laugh"
234,226-250,42,041-045,"It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew's and to find himself in a bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"'Ha, ha"
24,026-050,3,003-005,"laughed Scrooge's nephew"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"'Ha, ha, ha"
152,151-175,32,031-035,"If you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blest in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew, all I can say is, I should like to know him too"
56,051-075,9,009-010,"Introduce him to me, and I'll cultivate his acquaintance"
192,176-200,31,031-035,"It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour"
196,176-200,31,031-035,"When Scrooge's nephew laughed in this way: holding his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions: Scrooge's niece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he"
74,076-010,12,011-015,"And their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"'Ha, ha"
14,011-025,4,003-005,"Ha, ha, ha, ha"
47,051-075,10,009-010,"'He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live"
22,026-050,3,003-005,"cried Scrooge's nephew"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"'He believed it too"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"'More shame for him, Fred"
33,026-050,4,003-005,"said Scrooge's niece, indignantly"
51,051-075,9,009-010,"Bless those women; they never do anything by halves"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"They are always in earnest"
39,026-050,6,006-008,"She was very pretty: exceedingly pretty"
286,more,51,051-055,"With a dimpled, surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made to be kissed--as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature's head"
88,076-010,14,011-015,"Altogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory, too"
26,026-050,3,003-005,"Oh, perfectly satisfactory"
105,101-125,19,016-020,"'He's a comical old fellow,' said Scrooge's nephew, 'that's the truth: and not so pleasant as he might be"
87,076-010,15,011-015,"However, his offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him"
56,051-075,10,009-010,"'I'm sure he is very rich, Fred,' hinted Scrooge's niece"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"'At least you always tell me so"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"'What of that, my dear"
21,011-025,3,003-005,"said Scrooge's nephew"
31,026-050,8,006-008,"'His wealth is of no use to him"
28,026-050,7,006-008,"He don't do any good with it"
41,051-075,7,006-008,"He don't make himself comfortable with it"
50,051-075,8,006-008,"He hasn't the satisfaction of thinking--ha, ha, ha"
45,051-075,10,009-010,"--that he is ever going to benefit US with it"
55,051-075,9,009-010,"'I have no patience with him,' observed Scrooge's niece"
79,076-010,12,011-015,"Scrooge's niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"'Oh, I have"
21,011-025,3,003-005,"said Scrooge's nephew"
60,051-075,14,011-015,"'I am sorry for him; I couldn't be angry with him if I tried"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"Who suffers by his ill whims"
15,011-025,2,000-002,"Himself, always"
81,076-010,18,016-020,"Here, he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won't come and dine with us"
22,026-050,3,003-005,"What's the consequence"
30,026-050,7,006-008,"He don't lose much of a dinner"
74,076-010,12,011-015,"'Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,' interrupted Scrooge's niece"
201,201-225,35,031-035,"Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have been competent judges, because they had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"'Well"
108,101-125,18,016-020,"I'm very glad to hear it,' said Scrooge's nephew, 'because I haven't great faith in these young housekeepers"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"What do you say, Topper"
179,176-200,33,031-035,"Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's sisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no right to express an opinion on the subject"
105,101-125,16,016-020,"Whereat Scrooge's niece's sister--the plump one with the lace tucker: not the one with the roses--blushed"
58,051-075,10,009-010,"'Do go on, Fred,' said Scrooge's niece, clapping her hands"
40,026-050,8,006-008,"'He never finishes what he begins to say"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"He is such a ridiculous fellow"
199,176-200,33,031-035,"Scrooge's nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was unanimously followed"
212,201-225,41,041-045,"'I was only going to say,' said Scrooge's nephew, 'that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm"
133,126-150,25,021-025,"I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts, either in his mouldy old office, or his dusty chambers"
89,076-010,20,016-020,"I mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for I pity him"
190,176-200,36,036-040,"He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can't help thinking better of it--I defy him--if he finds me going there, in good temper, year after year, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how are you"
121,101-125,24,021-025,"If it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, that's something; and I think I shook him yesterday"
67,076-010,14,011-015,"It was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking Scrooge"
180,176-200,30,026-030,"But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the bottle joyously"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"After tea, they had some music"
261,251-275,53,051-055,"For they were a musical family, and knew what they were about, when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over it"
293,more,52,051-055,"Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of Christmas Past"
344,more,62,more,"When this strain of music sounded, all the things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he softened more and more; and thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands, without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob Marley"
49,051-075,9,009-010,"But they didn't devote the whole evening to music"
159,151-175,29,026-030,"After a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"Stop"
42,051-075,8,006-008,"There was first a game at blind-man's buff"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"Of course there was"
85,076-010,18,016-020,"And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes in his boots"
121,101-125,23,021-025,"My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and Scrooge's nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it"
107,101-125,21,021-025,"The way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the credulity of human nature"
154,151-175,23,021-025,"Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano, smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went, there went he"
41,051-075,8,006-008,"He always knew where the plump sister was"
30,026-050,5,003-005,"He wouldn't catch anybody else"
253,251-275,47,046-050,"If you had fallen up against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister"
62,076-010,13,011-015,"She often cried out that it wasn't fair; and it really was not"
205,201-225,39,036-040,"But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct was the most execrable"
243,226-250,43,041-045,"For his pretending not to know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous"
142,126-150,24,021-025,"No doubt she told him her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in office, they were so very confidential together, behind the curtains"
187,176-200,34,031-035,"Scrooge's niece was not one of the blind-man's buff party, but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her"
101,101-125,19,016-020,"But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet"
197,176-200,37,036-040,"Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you"
443,more,84,more,"There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in his head to be"
167,151-175,33,031-035,"The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed"
42,051-075,9,009-010,"But this the Spirit said could not be done"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"'Here is a new game,' said Scrooge"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"'One half hour, Spirit, only one"
179,176-200,36,036-040,"It was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew had to think of something, and the rest must find out what; he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case was"
513,more,102,more,"The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed, elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes, and lived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn't made a show of, and wasn't led by anybody, and didn't live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear"
180,176-200,35,031-035,"At every fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp"
66,076-010,12,011-015,"At last the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:"
20,011-025,5,003-005,"'I have found it out"
23,026-050,6,006-008,"I know what it is, Fred"
17,011-025,5,003-005,"I know what it is"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"'What is it"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"cried Fred"
31,026-050,4,003-005,"'It's your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"Which it certainly was"
92,076-010,16,016-020,"Admiration was the universal sentiment, though some objected that the reply to 'Is it a bear"
118,101-125,21,021-025,"ought to have been 'Yes;' inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from Mr"
58,051-075,10,009-010,"Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency that way"
112,101-125,22,021-025,"'He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure,' said Fred, 'and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health"
89,076-010,19,016-020,"Here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say, 'Uncle Scrooge"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"''"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"'Well"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"Uncle Scrooge"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"they cried"
70,076-010,15,011-015,"'A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is"
21,011-025,3,003-005,"said Scrooge's nephew"
62,076-010,12,011-015,"'He wouldn't take it from me, but may he have it, nevertheless"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"Uncle Scrooge"
200,176-200,35,031-035,"Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked them in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time"
135,126-150,27,026-030,"But the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels"
90,076-010,18,016-020,"Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but always with a happy end"
197,176-200,36,036-040,"The Spirit stood beside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by struggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was rich"
213,201-225,37,036-040,"In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery's every refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing, and taught Scrooge his precepts"
181,176-200,34,031-035,"It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together"
115,101-125,19,016-020,"It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly older"
209,201-225,38,036-040,"Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it, until they left a children's Twelfth Night party, when, looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its hair was grey"
28,026-050,5,003-005,"'Are spirits' lives so short"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"asked Scrooge"
59,051-075,11,011-015,"'My life upon this globe, is very brief,' replied the Ghost"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"'It ends to-night"
9,011-025,1,000-002,"'To-night"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"cried Scrooge"
21,011-025,3,003-005,"'To-night at midnight"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"Hark"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"The time is drawing near"
69,076-010,12,011-015,"The chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that moment"
191,176-200,33,031-035,"'Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,' said Scrooge, looking intently at the Spirit's robe, 'but I see something strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts"
22,026-050,7,006-008,"Is it a foot or a claw"
86,076-010,17,016-020,"'It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,' was the Spirit's sorrowful reply"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"'Look here"
103,101-125,15,011-015,"From the foldings of its robe, it brought two children; wretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable"
70,076-010,14,011-015,"They knelt down at its feet, and clung upon the outside of its garment"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"'Oh, Man"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"look here"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"Look, look, down here"
19,011-025,3,003-005,"exclaimed the Ghost"
24,026-050,6,006-008,"They were a boy and girl"
80,076-010,11,011-015,"Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility"
207,201-225,35,031-035,"Where graceful youth should have filled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds"
77,076-010,12,011-015,"Where angels might have sat enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing"
156,151-175,25,021-025,"No change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and dread"
30,026-050,4,003-005,"Scrooge started back, appalled"
170,151-175,32,031-035,"Having them shown to him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"'Spirit"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"are they yours"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"Scrooge could say no more"
57,051-075,10,009-010,"'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them"
51,051-075,9,009-010,"'And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"This boy is Ignorance"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"This girl is Want"
154,151-175,31,031-035,"Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"Deny it"
58,051-075,10,009-010,"cried the Spirit, stretching out its hand towards the city"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"'Slander those who tell it ye"
54,051-075,10,009-010,"Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"And bide the end"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"'Have they no refuge or resource"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"cried Scrooge"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"'Are there no prisons"
68,076-010,14,011-015,"said the Spirit, turning on him for the last time with his own words"
24,026-050,4,003-005,"'Are there no workhouses"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"The bell struck twelve"
54,051-075,11,011-015,"Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not"
206,201-225,36,036-040,"As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like a mist along the ground, towards him"
49,051-075,6,006-008,"THE Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached"
146,126-150,28,026-030,"When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery"
144,126-150,26,026-030,"It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand"
139,126-150,26,026-030,"But for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded"
125,101-125,24,021-025,"He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread"
55,051-075,11,011-015,"He knew no more, for the Spirit neither spoke nor moved"
59,051-075,13,011-015,"'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
57,051-075,10,009-010,"The Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand"
127,126-150,24,021-025,"'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened, but will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"'Is that so, Spirit"
115,101-125,22,021-025,"The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head"
36,026-050,7,006-008,"That was the only answer he received"
197,176-200,36,036-040,"Although well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it"
86,076-010,15,011-015,"The Spirit paused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to recover"
38,026-050,8,006-008,"But Scrooge was all the worse for this"
252,251-275,46,046-050,"It thrilled him with a vague uncertain horror, to know that behind the dusky shroud, there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his own to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap of black"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"'Ghost of the Future"
59,051-075,12,011-015,"he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre I have seen"
168,151-175,39,036-040,"But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company, and do it with a thankful heart"
24,026-050,6,006-008,"Will you not speak to me"
20,011-025,5,003-005,"It gave him no reply"
41,051-075,7,006-008,"The hand was pointed straight before them"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"'Lead on"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"'Lead on"
63,076-010,14,011-015,"The night is waning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"Lead on, Spirit"
49,051-075,10,009-010,"The Phantom moved away as it had come towards him"
97,076-010,18,016-020,"Scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him along"
125,101-125,24,021-025,"They scarcely seemed to enter the city; for the city rather seemed to spring up about them, and encompass them of its own act"
293,more,52,051-055,"But there they were, in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried up and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully with their great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had seen them often"
57,051-075,10,009-010,"The Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men"
85,076-010,15,011-015,"Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their talk"
89,076-010,18,016-020,"'No,' said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, 'I don't know much about it, either way"
21,011-025,5,003-005,"I only know he's dead"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"'When did he die"
16,011-025,2,000-002,"inquired another"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"'Last night, I believe"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"'Why, what was the matter with him"
76,076-010,15,011-015,"asked a third, taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"'I thought he'd never die"
40,026-050,8,006-008,"'God knows,' said the first, with a yawn"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"'What has he done with his money"
123,101-125,22,021-025,"asked a red-faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that shook like the gills of a turkey-cock"
66,076-010,12,011-015,"'I haven't heard,' said the man with the large chin, yawning again"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"'Left it to his company, perhaps"
23,026-050,6,006-008,"He hasn't left it to me"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"That's all I know"
49,051-075,8,006-008,"This pleasantry was received with a general laugh"
118,101-125,25,021-025,"'It's likely to be a very cheap funeral,' said the same speaker; 'for upon my life I don't know of anybody to go to it"
40,026-050,8,006-008,"Suppose we make up a party and volunteer"
100,076-010,18,016-020,"'I don't mind going if a lunch is provided,' observed the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose"
33,026-050,9,009-010,"'But I must be fed, if I make one"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"Another laugh"
135,126-150,25,021-025,"'Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,' said the first speaker, 'for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat lunch"
42,051-075,9,009-010,"But I'll offer to go, if anybody else will"
135,126-150,29,026-030,"When I come to think of it, I'm not at all sure that I wasn't his most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak whenever we met"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"Bye, bye"
65,076-010,10,009-010,"Speakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups"
70,076-010,12,011-015,"Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation"
35,026-050,7,006-008,"The Phantom glided on into a street"
41,051-075,7,006-008,"Its finger pointed to two persons meeting"
68,076-010,10,009-010,"Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie here"
34,026-050,6,006-008,"He knew these men, also, perfectly"
64,076-010,11,011-015,"They were men of business: very wealthy, and of great importance"
135,126-150,27,026-030,"He had made a point always of standing well in their esteem: in a business point of view, that is; strictly in a business point of view"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"'How are you"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"said one"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"'How are you"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"returned the other"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"'Well"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"said the first"
41,051-075,9,009-010,"'Old Scratch has got his own at last, hey"
35,026-050,7,006-008,"'So I am told,' returned the second"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"'Cold, isn't it"
30,026-050,4,003-005,"'Seasonable for Christmas time"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"You're not a skater, I suppose"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"'No"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"No"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"Something else to think of"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"Good morning"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"Not another word"
61,051-075,9,009-010,"That was their meeting, their conversation, and their parting"
239,226-250,40,036-040,"Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be"
151,151-175,28,026-030,"They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was Past, and this Ghost's province was the Future"
93,076-010,17,016-020,"Nor could he think of any one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could apply them"
240,226-250,41,041-045,"But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every word he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the shadow of himself when it appeared"
148,126-150,28,026-030,"For he had an expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would render the solution of these riddles easy"
256,251-275,48,046-050,"He looked about in that very place for his own image; but another man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured in through the Porch"
167,151-175,31,031-035,"It gave him little surprise, however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out in this"
72,076-010,12,011-015,"Quiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched hand"
178,176-200,32,031-035,"When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly"
39,026-050,8,006-008,"It made him shudder, and feel very cold"
168,151-175,29,026-030,"They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute"
108,101-125,17,016-020,"The ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched; the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly"
192,176-200,31,031-035,"Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery"
167,151-175,28,026-030,"Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought"
133,126-150,23,021-025,"Upon the floor within, were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds"
142,126-150,24,021-025,"Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and sepulchres of bones"
311,more,56,056-060,"Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the cold air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters, hung upon a line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement"
115,101-125,23,021-025,"Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop"
234,226-250,44,041-045,"But she had scarcely entered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each other"
129,126-150,25,021-025,"After a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh"
40,026-050,8,006-008,"'Let the charwoman alone to be the first"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"cried she who had entered first"
93,076-010,18,016-020,"'Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the undertaker's man alone to be the third"
35,026-050,7,006-008,"Look here, old Joe, here's a chance"
51,051-075,10,009-010,"If we haven't all three met here without meaning it"
89,076-010,17,016-020,"'You couldn't have met in a better place,' said old Joe, removing his pipe from his mouth"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"'Come into the parlour"
77,076-010,16,016-020,"You were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other two an't strangers"
37,026-050,9,009-010,"Stop till I shut the door of the shop"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Ah"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"How it skreeks"
132,126-150,28,026-030,"There an't such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's no such old bones here, as mine"
6,000-010,2,000-002,"Ha, ha"
53,051-075,9,009-010,"We're all suitable to our calling, we're well matched"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"Come into the parlour"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"Come into the parlour"
51,051-075,10,009-010,"The parlour was the space behind the screen of rags"
165,151-175,33,031-035,"The old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again"
213,201-225,42,041-045,"While he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"'What odds then"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"What odds, Mrs"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Dilber"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"said the woman"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"'Every person has a right to take care of themselves"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"He always did"
20,011-025,3,003-005,"'That's true, indeed"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"said the laundress"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"'No man more so"
75,076-010,14,011-015,"'Why then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid, woman; who's the wiser"
62,076-010,12,011-015,"We're not going to pick holes in each other's coats, I suppose"
11,011-025,2,000-002,"'No, indeed"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"said Mrs"
27,026-050,5,003-005,"Dilber and the man together"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"'We should hope not"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"'Very well, then"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"cried the woman"
14,011-025,2,000-002,"'That's enough"
55,051-075,12,011-015,"Who's the worse for the loss of a few things like these"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"Not a dead man, I suppose"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"'No, indeed,' said Mrs"
16,011-025,2,000-002,"Dilber, laughing"
123,101-125,24,021-025,"'If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked old screw,' pursued the woman, 'why wasn't he natural in his lifetime"
149,126-150,29,026-030,"If he had been, he'd have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"'It's the truest word that ever was spoke,' said Mrs"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Dilber"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"'It's a judgment on him"
158,151-175,31,031-035,"'I wish it was a little heavier judgment,' replied the woman; 'and it should have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands on anything else"
58,051-075,13,011-015,"Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"Speak out plain"
61,051-075,14,011-015,"I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to see it"
81,076-010,15,011-015,"We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves, before we met here, I believe"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"It's no sin"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"Open the bundle, Joe"
133,126-150,24,021-025,"But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first, produced his plunder"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"It was not extensive"
96,076-010,19,016-020,"A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no great value, were all"
200,176-200,39,036-040,"They were severally examined and appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a total when he found there was nothing more to come"
110,101-125,21,021-025,"'That's your account,' said Joe, 'and I wouldn't give another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"Who's next"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"Mrs"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"Dilber was next"
119,101-125,19,016-020,"Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a few boots"
53,051-075,11,011-015,"Her account was stated on the wall in the same manner"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"'I always give too much to ladies"
72,076-010,15,011-015,"It's a weakness of mine, and that's the way I ruin myself,' said old Joe"
20,011-025,3,003-005,"'That's your account"
122,101-125,23,021-025,"If you asked me for another penny, and made it an open question, I'd repent of being so liberal and knock off half-a-crown"
51,051-075,10,009-010,"'And now undo my bundle, Joe,' said the first woman"
165,151-175,31,031-035,"Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"'What do you call this"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"said Joe"
13,011-025,1,000-002,"'Bed-curtains"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"'Ah"
68,076-010,11,011-015,"returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms"
13,011-025,1,000-002,"'Bed-curtains"
77,076-010,16,016-020,"'You don't mean to say you took 'em down, rings and all, with him lying there"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"said Joe"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"'Yes I do,' replied the woman"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"'Why not"
75,076-010,14,011-015,"'You were born to make your fortune,' said Joe, 'and you'll certainly do it"
168,151-175,35,031-035,"'I certainly shan't hold my hand, when I can get anything in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He was, I promise you, Joe,' returned the woman coolly"
43,051-075,8,006-008,"'Don't drop that oil upon the blankets, now"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"'His blankets"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"asked Joe"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"'Whose else's do you think"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"replied the woman"
53,051-075,11,011-015,"'He isn't likely to take cold without 'em, I dare say"
42,051-075,8,006-008,"'I hope he didn't die of anything catching"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Eh"
50,051-075,10,009-010,"said old Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up"
49,051-075,9,009-010,"'Don't you be afraid of that,' returned the woman"
83,076-010,18,016-020,"'I an't so fond of his company that I'd loiter about him for such things, if he did"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Ah"
108,101-125,22,021-025,"you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache; but you won't find a hole in it, nor a threadbare place"
40,026-050,10,009-010,"It's the best he had, and a fine one too"
47,051-075,10,009-010,"They'd have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"'What do you call wasting of it"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"asked old Joe"
79,076-010,17,016-020,"'Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,' replied the woman with a laugh"
59,051-075,13,011-015,"'Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again"
80,076-010,15,011-015,"If calico an't good enough for such a purpose, it isn't good enough for anything"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"It's quite as becoming to the body"
44,051-075,10,009-010,"He can't look uglier than he did in that one"
43,051-075,7,006-008,"Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror"
240,226-250,41,041-045,"As they sat grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man's lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and disgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"'Ha, ha"
124,101-125,23,021-025,"laughed the same woman, when old Joe, producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground"
31,026-050,8,006-008,"'This is the end of it, you see"
86,076-010,18,016-020,"He frightened every one away from him when he was alive, to profit us when he was dead"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"Ha, ha, ha"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"'Spirit"
42,051-075,7,006-008,"said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot"
13,011-025,4,003-005,"'I see, I see"
44,051-075,10,009-010,"The case of this unhappy man might be my own"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"My life tends that way, now"
29,026-050,5,003-005,"Merciful Heaven, what is this"
237,226-250,42,041-045,"He recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now he almost touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which, beneath a ragged sheet, there lay a something covered up, which, though it was dumb, announced itself in awful language"
173,151-175,33,031-035,"The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy, though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it was"
156,151-175,29,026-030,"A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man"
35,026-050,5,003-005,"Scrooge glanced towards the Phantom"
39,026-050,8,006-008,"Its steady hand was pointed to the head"
144,126-150,25,021-025,"The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the face"
154,151-175,34,031-035,"He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it; but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side"
147,126-150,28,026-030,"Oh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command: for this is thy dominion"
124,101-125,23,021-025,"But of the loved, revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious"
217,201-225,44,041-045,"It is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released; it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand WAS open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender; and the pulse a man's"
22,026-050,3,003-005,"Strike, Shadow, strike"
84,076-010,16,016-020,"And see his good deeds springing from the wound, to sow the world with life immortal"
100,076-010,19,016-020,"No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed"
83,076-010,16,016-020,"He thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be his foremost thoughts"
36,026-050,4,003-005,"Avarice, hard-dealing, griping cares"
42,051-075,9,009-010,"They have brought him to a rich end, truly"
174,151-175,42,041-045,"He lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child, to say that he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be kind to him"
93,076-010,18,016-020,"A cat was tearing at the door, and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone"
113,101-125,22,021-025,"What they wanted in the room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"'Spirit"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"he said, 'this is a fearful place"
53,051-075,11,011-015,"In leaving it, I shall not leave its lesson, trust me"
9,011-025,3,003-005,"Let us go"
58,051-075,11,011-015,"Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head"
68,076-010,13,011-015,"'I understand you,' Scrooge returned, 'and I would do it, if I could"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"But I have not the power, Spirit"
20,011-025,5,003-005,"I have not the power"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"Again it seemed to look upon him"
159,151-175,29,026-030,"'If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion caused by this man's death,' said Scrooge quite agonised, 'show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you"
156,151-175,29,026-030,"The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing; and withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her children were"
274,251-275,51,051-055,"She was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness; for she walked up and down the room; started at every sound; looked out from the window; glanced at the clock; tried, but in vain, to work with her needle; and could hardly bear the voices of the children in their play"
43,051-075,7,006-008,"At length the long-expected knock was heard"
110,101-125,21,021-025,"She hurried to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though he was young"
130,126-150,24,021-025,"There was a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress"
192,176-200,37,036-040,"He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a long silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"'Is it good"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"she said, 'or bad"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"--to help him"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"'Bad,' he answered"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"'We are quite ruined"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"'No"
27,026-050,5,003-005,"There is hope yet, Caroline"
44,051-075,8,006-008,"'If he relents,' she said, amazed, 'there is"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"Nothing is past hope, if such a miracle has happened"
40,026-050,7,006-008,"'He is past relenting,' said her husband"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"'He is dead"
141,126-150,29,026-030,"She was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so, with clasped hands"
97,076-010,18,016-020,"She prayed forgiveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of her heart"
206,201-225,43,041-045,"'What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last night, said to me, when I tried to see him and obtain a week's delay; and what I thought was a mere excuse to avoid me; turns out to have been quite true"
41,051-075,9,009-010,"He was not only very ill, but dying, then"
37,026-050,7,006-008,"'To whom will our debt be transferred"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"'I don't know"
165,151-175,33,031-035,"But before that time we shall be ready with the money; and even though we were not, it would be a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor"
49,051-075,8,006-008,"We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"Yes"
50,051-075,9,009-010,"Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter"
151,151-175,26,026-030,"The children's faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man's death"
88,076-010,17,016-020,"The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of pleasure"
152,151-175,28,026-030,"'Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,' said Scrooge; 'or that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be for ever present to me"
170,151-175,31,031-035,"The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen"
135,126-150,23,021-025,"They entered poor Bob Cratchit's house; the dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the children seated round the fire"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"Quiet"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"Very quiet"
121,101-125,24,021-025,"The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him"
51,051-075,9,009-010,"The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"But surely they were very quiet"
55,051-075,13,011-015,"''And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"''"
35,026-050,6,006-008,"Where had Scrooge heard those words"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"He had not dreamed them"
75,076-010,15,011-015,"The boy must have read them out, as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold"
20,011-025,6,006-008,"Why did he not go on"
72,076-010,16,016-020,"The mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her face"
36,026-050,7,006-008,"'The colour hurts my eyes,' she said"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"The colour"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"Ah, poor Tiny Tim"
48,051-075,7,006-008,"'They're better now again,' said Cratchit's wife"
115,101-125,22,021-025,"'It makes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn't show weak eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world"
24,026-050,6,006-008,"It must be near his time"
54,051-075,9,009-010,"'Past it rather,' Peter answered, shutting up his book"
88,076-010,17,016-020,"'But I think he has walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings, mother"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"They were very quiet again"
75,076-010,14,011-015,"At last she said, and in a steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:"
100,076-010,19,016-020,"'I have known him walk with--I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"'And so have I,' cried Peter"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"'Often"
34,026-050,6,006-008,"'And so have I,' exclaimed another"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"So had all"
133,126-150,26,026-030,"'But he was very light to carry,' she resumed, intent upon her work, 'and his father loved him so, that it was no trouble: no trouble"
36,026-050,8,006-008,"And there is your father at the door"
102,101-125,20,016-020,"She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter --he had need of it, poor fellow--came in"
87,076-010,20,016-020,"His tea was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should help him to it most"
142,126-150,27,026-030,"Then the two young Cratchits got upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against his face, as if they said, 'Don't mind it, father"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"Don't be grieved"
71,076-010,13,011-015,"Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family"
79,076-010,16,016-020,"He looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed of Mrs"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"Cratchit and the girls"
46,051-075,9,009-010,"They would be done long before Sunday, he said"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"'Sunday"
29,026-050,5,003-005,"You went to-day, then, Robert"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"said his wife"
28,026-050,5,003-005,"'Yes, my dear,' returned Bob"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"'I wish you could have gone"
58,051-075,14,011-015,"It would have done you good to see how green a place it is"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"But you'll see it often"
50,051-075,11,011-015,"I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"My little, little child"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"cried Bob"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"'My little child"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"He broke down all at once"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"He couldn't help it"
97,076-010,19,016-020,"If he could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they were"
111,101-125,19,016-020,"He left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above, which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas"
104,101-125,20,016-020,"There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were signs of some one having been there, lately"
105,101-125,21,021-025,"Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed himself, he kissed the little face"
71,076-010,13,011-015,"He was reconciled to what had happened, and went down again quite happy"
72,076-010,13,011-015,"They drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother working still"
49,051-075,9,009-010,"Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr"
218,201-225,39,036-040,"Scrooge's nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing that he looked a little--'just a little down you know,' said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him"
92,076-010,16,016-020,"'On which,' said Bob, 'for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman you ever heard, I told him"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"'I am heartily sorry for it, Mr"
58,051-075,10,009-010,"Cratchit,' he said, 'and heartily sorry for your good wife"
49,051-075,12,011-015,"' By the bye, how he ever knew that, I don't know"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"'Knew what, my dear"
45,051-075,9,009-010,"'Why, that you were a good wife,' replied Bob"
21,011-025,3,003-005,"'Everybody knows that"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"said Peter"
27,026-050,5,003-005,"'Very well observed, my boy"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"cried Bob"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"'I hope they do"
46,051-075,8,006-008,"'Heartily sorry,' he said, 'for your good wife"
92,076-010,21,021-025,"If I can be of service to you in any way,' he said, giving me his card, 'that's where I live"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"Pray come to me"
146,126-150,31,031-035,"' Now, it wasn't,' cried Bob, 'for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite delightful"
66,076-010,15,011-015,"It really seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and felt with us"
26,026-050,6,006-008,"'I'm sure he's a good soul"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"said Mrs"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Cratchit"
79,076-010,17,016-020,"'You would be surer of it, my dear,' returned Bob, 'if you saw and spoke to him"
49,051-075,10,009-010,"I shouldn't be at all surprised-- mark what I say"
36,026-050,7,006-008,"--if he got Peter a better situation"
33,026-050,6,006-008,"'Only hear that, Peter,' said Mrs"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Cratchit"
108,101-125,20,016-020,"'And then,' cried one of the girls, 'Peter will be keeping company with some one, and setting up for himself"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"'Get along with you"
24,026-050,3,003-005,"retorted Peter, grinning"
107,101-125,21,021-025,"'It's just as likely as not,' said Bob, 'one of these days; though there's plenty of time for that, my dear"
158,151-175,30,026-030,"But however and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim--shall we--or this first parting that there was among us"
14,011-025,2,000-002,"'Never, father"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"cried they all"
220,201-225,42,041-045,"'And I know,' said Bob, 'I know, my dears, that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"'No, never, father"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"they all cried again"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"'I am very happy,' said little Bob, 'I am very happy"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"Mrs"
116,101-125,19,016-020,"Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands"
53,051-075,10,009-010,"Spirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from God"
81,076-010,13,011-015,"'Spectre,' said Scrooge, 'something informs me that our parting moment is at hand"
29,026-050,8,006-008,"I know it, but I know not how"
48,051-075,11,011-015,"Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead"
250,226-250,43,041-045,"The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as before--though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were in the Future--into the resorts of business men, but showed him not himself"
147,126-150,28,026-030,"Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for anything, but went straight on, as to the end just now desired, until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment"
126,126-150,24,021-025,"'This court,' said Scrooge, 'through which we hurry now, is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length of time"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"I see the house"
46,051-075,11,011-015,"Let me behold what I shall be, in days to come"
50,051-075,8,006-008,"The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere"
40,026-050,6,006-008,"'The house is yonder,' Scrooge exclaimed"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"'Why do you point away"
41,051-075,6,006-008,"The inexorable finger underwent no change"
59,051-075,11,011-015,"Scrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked in"
35,026-050,8,006-008,"It was an office still, but not his"
75,076-010,15,011-015,"The furniture was not the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself"
29,026-050,5,003-005,"The Phantom pointed as before"
114,101-125,21,021-025,"He joined it once again, and wondering why and whither he had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate"
39,026-050,7,006-008,"He paused to look round before entering"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"A churchyard"
86,076-010,16,016-020,"Here, then; the wretched man whose name he had now to learn, lay underneath the ground"
21,011-025,5,003-005,"It was a worthy place"
152,151-175,26,026-030,"Walled in by houses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation's death, not life; choked up with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"A worthy place"
58,051-075,11,011-015,"The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to One"
32,026-050,5,003-005,"He advanced towards it trembling"
98,076-010,20,016-020,"The Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape"
94,076-010,17,016-020,"'Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,' said Scrooge, 'answer me one question"
97,076-010,20,016-020,"Are these the shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of things that May be, only"
63,076-010,12,011-015,"Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood"
102,101-125,16,016-020,"'Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in, they must lead,' said Scrooge"
58,051-075,11,011-015,"'But if the courses be departed from, the ends will change"
36,026-050,9,009-010,"Say it is thus with what you show me"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"The Spirit was immovable as ever"
147,126-150,25,021-025,"Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name, EBENEZER SCROOGE"
35,026-050,9,009-010,"'Am I that man who lay upon the bed"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"he cried, upon his knees"
56,051-075,11,011-015,"The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again"
11,011-025,2,000-002,"'No, Spirit"
9,011-025,3,003-005,"Oh no, no"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"The finger still was there"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"'Spirit"
47,051-075,9,009-010,"he cried, tight clutching at its robe, 'hear me"
22,026-050,7,006-008,"I am not the man I was"
63,076-010,14,011-015,"I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse"
39,026-050,10,009-010,"Why show me this, if I am past all hope"
45,051-075,9,009-010,"For the first time the hand appeared to shake"
115,101-125,21,021-025,"'Good Spirit,' he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell before it: 'Your nature intercedes for me, and pities me"
83,076-010,17,016-020,"Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you have shown me, by an altered life"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"The kind hand trembled"
69,076-010,15,011-015,"'I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future"
47,051-075,9,009-010,"The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me"
47,051-075,10,009-010,"I will not shut out the lessons that they teach"
55,051-075,12,011-015,"Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone"
41,051-075,8,006-008,"In his agony, he caught the spectral hand"
76,076-010,15,011-015,"It sought to free itself, but he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it"
38,026-050,6,006-008,"The Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him"
117,101-125,23,021-025,"Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed, he saw an alteration in the Phantom's hood and dress"
54,051-075,9,009-010,"It shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"YES"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"and the bedpost was his own"
41,051-075,10,009-010,"The bed was his own, the room was his own"
76,076-010,16,016-020,"Best and happiest of all, the Time before him was his own, to make amends in"
53,051-075,11,011-015,"'I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future"
44,051-075,8,006-008,"Scrooge repeated, as he scrambled out of bed"
48,051-075,9,009-010,"'The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"Oh Jacob Marley"
50,051-075,9,009-010,"Heaven, and the Christmas Time be praised for this"
44,051-075,11,011-015,"I say it on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees"
116,101-125,21,021-025,"He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions, that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his call"
94,076-010,18,016-020,"He had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the Spirit, and his face was wet with tears"
124,101-125,23,021-025,"'They are not torn down,' cried Scrooge, folding one of his bed-curtains in his arms, 'they are not torn down, rings and all"
90,076-010,16,016-020,"They are here--I am here--the shadows of the things that would have been, may be dispelled"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"They will be"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"I know they will"
186,176-200,31,031-035,"His hands were busy with his garments all this time; turning them inside out, putting them on upside down, tearing them, mislaying them, making them parties to every kind of extravagance"
24,026-050,6,006-008,"'I don't know what to do"
113,101-125,19,016-020,"cried Scrooge, laughing and crying in the same breath; and making a perfect Laocoön of himself with his stockings"
84,076-010,21,021-025,"'I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy"
30,026-050,8,006-008,"I am as giddy as a drunken man"
30,026-050,5,003-005,"A merry Christmas to everybody"
33,026-050,8,006-008,"A happy New Year to all the world"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"Hallo here"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"Whoop"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"Hallo"
82,076-010,13,011-015,"He had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing there: perfectly winded"
43,051-075,8,006-008,"'There's the saucepan that the gruel was in"
64,076-010,10,009-010,"cried Scrooge, starting off again, and going round the fireplace"
61,051-075,11,011-015,"'There's the door, by which the Ghost of Jacob Marley entered"
60,051-075,10,009-010,"There's the corner where the Ghost of Christmas Present, sat"
52,051-075,9,009-010,"There's the window where I saw the wandering Spirits"
46,051-075,9,009-010,"It's all right, it's all true, it all happened"
8,000-010,3,003-005,"Ha ha ha"
115,101-125,23,021-025,"Really, for a man who had been out of practice for so many years, it was a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh"
51,051-075,10,009-010,"The father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs"
41,051-075,10,009-010,"'I don't know what day of the month it is"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
50,051-075,10,009-010,"'I don't know how long I've been among the Spirits"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"I don't know anything"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"I'm quite a baby"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"Never mind"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"I don't care"
20,011-025,5,003-005,"I'd rather be a baby"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"Hallo"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"Whoop"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"Hallo here"
97,076-010,18,016-020,"He was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever heard"
38,026-050,6,006-008,"Clash, clang, hammer; ding, dong, bell"
38,026-050,6,006-008,"Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, clash"
22,026-050,3,003-005,"Oh, glorious, glorious"
57,051-075,12,011-015,"Running to the window, he opened it, and put out his head"
155,151-175,26,026-030,"No fog, no mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, piping for the blood to dance to; Golden sunlight; Heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry bells"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"Oh, glorious"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Glorious"
14,011-025,2,000-002,"'What's to-day"
105,101-125,19,016-020,"cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"'EH"
46,051-075,9,009-010,"returned the boy, with all his might of wonder"
30,026-050,5,003-005,"'What's to-day, my fine fellow"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"'To-day"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"replied the boy"
19,011-025,3,003-005,"'Why, CHRISTMAS DAY"
19,011-025,3,003-005,"'It's Christmas Day"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"said Scrooge to himself"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"'I haven't missed it"
41,051-075,9,009-010,"The Spirits have done it all in one night"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"They can do anything they like"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"Of course they can"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"Of course they can"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"Hallo, my fine fellow"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"'Hallo"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"returned the boy"
71,076-010,14,011-015,"'Do you know the Poulterer's, in the next street but one, at the corner"
16,011-025,2,000-002,"Scrooge inquired"
38,026-050,8,006-008,"'I should hope I did,' replied the lad"
19,011-025,3,003-005,"'An intelligent boy"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"'A remarkable boy"
75,076-010,14,011-015,"Do you know whether they've sold the prize Turkey that was hanging up there"
42,051-075,8,006-008,"--Not the little prize Turkey: the big one"
27,026-050,7,006-008,"'What, the one as big as me"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"returned the boy"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"'What a delightful boy"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"'It's a pleasure to talk to him"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"Yes, my buck"
41,051-075,7,006-008,"'It's hanging there now,' replied the boy"
6,000-010,2,000-002,"'Is it"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
14,011-025,4,003-005,"'Go and buy it"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"'Walk-ER"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"exclaimed the boy"
40,026-050,8,006-008,"'No, no,' said Scrooge, 'I am in earnest"
97,076-010,22,021-025,"Go and buy it, and tell 'em to bring it here, that I may give them the direction where to take it"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"Come back with the man, and I'll give you a shilling"
75,076-010,14,011-015,"Come back with him in less than five minutes and I'll give you half-a-crown"
27,026-050,7,006-008,"The boy was off like a shot"
86,076-010,20,016-020,"He must have had a steady hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"'I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's"
64,076-010,10,009-010,"whispered Scrooge, rubbing his hands, and splitting with a laugh"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"'He sha'n't know who sends it"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"It's twice the size of Tiny Tim"
64,076-010,14,011-015,"Joe Miller never made such a joke as sending it to Bob's will be"
180,176-200,35,031-035,"The hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one, but write it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to open the street door, ready for the coming of the poulterer's man"
66,076-010,12,011-015,"As he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker caught his eye"
35,026-050,9,009-010,"'I shall love it, as long as I live"
39,026-050,7,006-008,"cried Scrooge, patting it with his hand"
36,026-050,7,006-008,"'I scarcely ever looked at it before"
44,051-075,9,009-010,"What an honest expression it has in its face"
24,026-050,4,003-005,"It's a wonderful knocker"
19,011-025,3,003-005,"--Here's the Turkey"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"Hallo"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"Whoop"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"How are you"
15,011-025,2,000-002,"Merry Christmas"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"It was a Turkey"
50,051-075,10,009-010,"He never could have stood upon his legs, that bird"
75,076-010,14,011-015,"He would have snapped 'em short off in a minute, like sticks of sealing-wax"
65,076-010,11,011-015,"'Why, it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town,' said Scrooge"
20,011-025,5,003-005,"'You must have a cab"
307,more,59,056-060,"The chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which he paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and chuckled till he cried"
150,126-150,28,026-030,"Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very much; and shaving requires attention, even when you don't dance while you are at it"
123,101-125,25,021-025,"But if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of sticking-plaister over it, and been quite satisfied"
74,076-010,15,011-015,"He dressed himself 'all in his best,' and at last got out into the streets"
189,176-200,34,031-035,"The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present; and walking with his hands behind him, Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile"
112,101-125,18,016-020,"He looked so irresistibly pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured fellows said, 'Good morning, sir"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"A merry Christmas to you"
119,101-125,22,021-025,"And Scrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears"
177,176-200,31,031-035,"He had not gone far, when coming on towards him he beheld the portly gentleman, who had walked into his counting-house the day before, and said, 'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe"
160,151-175,33,031-035,"It sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but he knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it"
96,076-010,17,016-020,"'My dear sir,' said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and taking the old gentleman by both his hands"
14,011-025,4,003-005,"'How do you do"
30,026-050,5,003-005,"I hope you succeeded yesterday"
23,026-050,6,006-008,"It was very kind of you"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"A merry Christmas to you, sir"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"'Mr"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"Scrooge"
19,011-025,3,003-005,"'Yes,' said Scrooge"
58,051-075,14,011-015,"'That is my name, and I fear it may not be pleasant to you"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"Allow me to ask your pardon"
66,076-010,11,011-015,"And will you have the goodness'--here Scrooge whispered in his ear"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"'Lord bless me"
53,051-075,10,009-010,"cried the gentleman, as if his breath were taken away"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"'My dear Mr"
24,026-050,4,003-005,"Scrooge, are you serious"
29,026-050,5,003-005,"'If you please,' said Scrooge"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"'Not a farthing less"
59,051-075,11,011-015,"A great many back-payments are included in it, I assure you"
26,026-050,6,006-008,"Will you do me that favour"
53,051-075,10,009-010,"'My dear sir,' said the other, shaking hands with him"
43,051-075,9,009-010,"'I don't know what to say to such munifi--'"
46,051-075,6,006-008,"'Don't say anything, please,' retorted Scrooge"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"'Come and see me"
24,026-050,6,006-008,"Will you come and see me"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"'I will"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"cried the old gentleman"
34,026-050,9,009-010,"And it was clear he meant to do it"
24,026-050,3,003-005,"'Thank'ee,' said Scrooge"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"'I am much obliged to you"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"I thank you fifty times"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"Bless you"
268,251-275,47,046-050,"He went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people hurrying to and fro, and patted children on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the windows, and found that everything could yield him pleasure"
83,076-010,13,011-015,"He had never dreamed that any walk--that anything--could give him so much happiness"
63,076-010,11,011-015,"In the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew's house"
78,076-010,17,016-020,"He passed the door a dozen times, before he had the courage to go up and knock"
31,026-050,8,006-008,"But he made a dash, and did it:"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"'Is your master at home, my dear"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"said Scrooge to the girl"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"Nice girl"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"Very"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"'Yes, sir"
21,011-025,5,003-005,"'Where is he, my love"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
50,051-075,8,006-008,"'He's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress"
38,026-050,7,006-008,"I'll show you up-stairs, if you please"
9,011-025,1,000-002,"'Thank'ee"
73,076-010,13,011-015,"He knows me,' said Scrooge, with his hand already on the dining-room lock"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"'I'll go in here, my dear"
59,051-075,12,011-015,"He turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door"
174,151-175,31,031-035,"They were looking at the table (which was spread out in great array); for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see that everything is right"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"'Fred"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"said Scrooge"
51,051-075,9,009-010,"Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started"
134,126-150,24,021-025,"Scrooge had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner with the footstool, or he wouldn't have done it, on any account"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"'Why bless my soul"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"cried Fred, 'who's that"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"'It's I"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"Your uncle Scrooge"
21,011-025,5,003-005,"I have come to dinner"
24,026-050,6,006-008,"Will you let me in, Fred"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"Let him in"
41,051-075,10,009-010,"It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off"
30,026-050,7,006-008,"He was at home in five minutes"
25,026-050,4,003-005,"Nothing could be heartier"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"His niece looked just the same"
26,026-050,6,006-008,"So did Topper when he came"
37,026-050,8,006-008,"So did the plump sister when she came"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"So did every one when they came"
76,076-010,8,006-008,"Wonderful party, wonderful games, wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness"
43,051-075,9,009-010,"But he was early at the office next morning"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"Oh, he was early there"
67,076-010,13,011-015,"If he could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit coming late"
44,051-075,10,009-010,"That was the thing he had set his heart upon"
26,026-050,7,006-008,"And he did it; yes, he did"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"The clock struck nine"
6,000-010,2,000-002,"No Bob"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"A quarter past"
6,000-010,2,000-002,"No Bob"
55,051-075,11,011-015,"He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time"
77,076-010,16,016-020,"Scrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the Tank"
61,051-075,12,011-015,"His hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter too"
104,101-125,22,021-025,"He was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his pen, as if he were trying to overtake nine o'clock"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"'Hallo"
70,076-010,13,011-015,"growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as near as he could feign it"
52,051-075,12,011-015,"'What do you mean by coming here at this time of day"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"'I am very sorry, sir,' said Bob"
20,011-025,5,003-005,"'I am behind my time"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"'You are"
16,011-025,2,000-002,"repeated Scrooge"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"'Yes"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"I think you are"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"Step this way, sir, if you please"
66,076-010,12,011-015,"'It's only once a year, sir,' pleaded Bob, appearing from the Tank"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"'It shall not be repeated"
40,026-050,7,006-008,"I was making rather merry yesterday, sir"
106,101-125,21,021-025,"'Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,' said Scrooge, 'I am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer"
187,176-200,34,031-035,"And therefore,' he continued, leaping from his stool, and giving Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into the Tank again; 'and therefore I am about to raise your salary"
50,051-075,10,009-010,"Bob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler"
141,126-150,26,026-030,"He had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and calling to the people in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"'A merry Christmas, Bob"
91,076-010,17,016-020,"said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back"
81,076-010,16,016-020,"'A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you, for many a year"
170,151-175,28,026-030,"I'll raise your salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of smoking bishop, Bob"
86,076-010,15,011-015,"Make up the fires, and buy another coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"Scrooge was better than his word"
92,076-010,20,016-020,"He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was a second father"
159,151-175,35,031-035,"He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world"
426,more,81,more,"Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less attractive forms"
56,051-075,11,011-015,"His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him"
220,201-225,38,036-040,"He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge"
43,051-075,11,011-015,"May that be truly said of us, and all of us"
53,051-075,11,011-015,"And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One"
240,226-250,43,041-045,"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore  While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door"
88,076-010,16,016-020,"''Tis some visitor,' I muttered, 'tapping at my chamber door  Only this and nothing more"
118,101-125,21,021-025,"Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December, And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor"
207,201-225,39,036-040,"Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost Lenore  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore  Nameless here for evermore"
334,more,58,056-060,"And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating ''Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door  Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door; This it is and nothing more"
340,more,63,more,"Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, 'Sir,' said I, 'or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you' here I opened wide the door  Darkness there and nothing more"
262,251-275,43,041-045,"Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, 'Lenore"
61,051-075,11,011-015,"This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, 'Lenore"
28,026-050,5,003-005,"Merely this and nothing more"
119,101-125,21,021-025,"Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before"
214,201-225,41,041-045,"'Surely,' said I, 'surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is and this mystery explore  Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;  'Tis the wind and nothing more"
128,126-150,25,021-025,"Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore"
223,201-225,44,041-045,"Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he, But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door  Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door  Perched, and sat, and nothing more"
318,more,58,056-060,"Then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, 'Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, 'art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore"
27,026-050,4,003-005,"Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore"
330,more,57,056-060,"Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, Though its answer little meaning little relevancy bore; For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, With such name as 'Nevermore"
323,more,62,more,"But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if its soul in that one word he did outpour Nothing farther then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered  Till I scarcely more than muttered: 'Other friends have flown before  On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before"
29,026-050,5,003-005,"Then the bird said 'Nevermore"
323,more,55,051-055,"Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, 'Doubtless,' said I, 'what it utters is its only stock and store, Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore  Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore Of 'Never nevermore"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"''"
344,more,61,more,"But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door; Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore  What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking 'Nevermore"
344,more,59,056-060,"This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er, But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore"
131,126-150,21,021-025,"Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor"
133,126-150,24,021-025,"'Wretch,' I cried, 'thy God hath lent thee by these angels he hath sent thee Respite respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore"
62,076-010,11,011-015,"Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore"
27,026-050,4,003-005,"Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"'Prophet"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"said I, 'thing of evil"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"prophet still, if bird or devil"
217,201-225,39,036-040,"Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted  On this home by Horror haunted tell me truly, I implore  Is there _is_ there balm in Gilead"
26,026-050,6,006-008,"tell me tell me, I implore"
27,026-050,4,003-005,"Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"'Prophet"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"said I, 'thing of evil"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"prophet still, if bird or devil"
246,226-250,48,046-050,"By that Heaven that bends above us by that God we both adore  Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore"
27,026-050,4,003-005,"Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore"
43,051-075,9,009-010,"'Be that our sign of parting, bird or fiend"
87,076-010,15,011-015,"I shrieked, upstarting  'Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore"
63,076-010,14,011-015,"Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken"
28,026-050,4,003-005,"Leave my loneliness unbroken"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"quit the bust above my door"
67,076-010,15,011-015,"Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door"
27,026-050,4,003-005,"Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore"
348,more,64,more,"And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadows on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted nevermore"
280,more,47,046-050,"A considerable number of hunting parties were out that year without finding so much as a fresh trail; for the moose were uncommonly shy, and the various Nimrods returned to the bosoms of their respective families with the best excuses the facts of their imaginations could suggest"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Dr"
173,151-175,31,031-035,"Cathcart, among others, came back without a trophy; but he brought instead the memory of an experience which he declares was worth all the bull moose that had ever been shot"
120,101-125,20,016-020,"But then Cathcart, of Aberdeen, was interested in other things besides moose amongst them the vagaries of the human mind"
257,251-275,46,046-050,"This particular story, however, found no mention in his book on Collective Hallucination for the simple reason (so he confided once to a fellow colleague) that he himself played too intimate a part in it to form a competent judgment of the affair as a whole"
206,201-225,34,031-035,"Besides himself and his guide, Hank Davis, there was young Simpson, his nephew, a divinity student destined for the 'Wee Kirk' (then on his first visit to Canadian backwoods), and the latter's guide, Défago"
357,more,60,056-060,"Joseph Défago was a French 'Canuck,' who had strayed from his native Province of Quebec years before, and had got caught in Rat Portage when the Canadian Pacific Railway was a-building; a man who, in addition to his unparalleled knowledge of wood-craft and bush-lore, could also sing the old _voyageur_ songs and tell a capital hunting yarn into the bargain"
215,201-225,35,031-035,"He was deeply susceptible, moreover, to that singular spell which the wilderness lays upon certain lonely natures, and he loved the wild solitudes with a kind of romantic passion that amounted almost to an obsession"
117,101-125,17,016-020,"The life of the backwoods fascinated him whence, doubtless, his surpassing efficiency in dealing with their mysteries"
50,051-075,8,006-008,"On this particular expedition he was Hank's choice"
30,026-050,7,006-008,"Hank knew him and swore by him"
223,201-225,38,036-040,"He also swore at him, 'jest as a pal might,' and since he had a vocabulary of picturesque, if utterly meaningless, oaths, the conversation between the two stalwart and hardy woodsmen was often of a rather lively description"
108,101-125,20,016-020,"This river of expletives, however, Hank agreed to dam a little out of respect for his old 'hunting boss,' Dr"
161,151-175,29,026-030,"Cathcart, whom of course he addressed after the fashion of the country as 'Doc,' and also because he understood that young Simpson was already a 'bit of a parson"
337,more,58,056-060,"He had, however, one objection to Défago, and one only which was, that the French Canadian sometimes exhibited what Hank described as 'the output of a cursed and dismal mind,' meaning apparently that he sometimes was true to type, Latin type, and suffered fits of a kind of silent moroseness when nothing could induce him to utter speech"
54,051-075,9,009-010,"Défago, that is to say, was imaginative and melancholy"
138,126-150,26,026-030,"And, as a rule, it was too long a spell of 'civilization' that induced the attacks, for a few days of the wilderness invariably cured them"
192,176-200,36,036-040,"This, then, was the party of four that found themselves in camp the last week in October of that 'shy moose year' 'way up in the wilderness north of Rat Portage a forsaken and desolate country"
54,051-075,10,009-010,"There was also Punk, an Indian, who had accompanied Dr"
81,076-010,15,011-015,"Cathcart and Hank on their hunting trips in previous years, and who acted as cook"
111,101-125,21,021-025,"His duty was merely to stay in camp, catch fish, and prepare venison steaks and coffee at a few minutes' notice"
231,226-250,43,041-045,"He dressed in the worn-out clothes bequeathed to him by former patrons, and, except for his coarse black hair and dark skin, he looked in these city garments no more like a real redskin than a stage native looks like a real African"
148,126-150,25,021-025,"For all that, however, Punk had in him still the instincts of his dying race; his taciturn silence and his endurance survived; also his superstition"
139,126-150,24,021-025,"The party round the blazing fire that night were despondent, for a week had passed without a single sign of recent moose discovering itself"
287,more,52,051-055,"Défago had sung his song and plunged into a story, but Hank, in bad humor, reminded him so often that 'he kep' mussing-up the fac's so, that it was 'most all nothin' but a petered-out lie,' that the Frenchman had finally subsided into a sulky silence which nothing seemed likely to break"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Dr"
64,076-010,11,011-015,"Cathcart and his nephew were fairly done after an exhausting day"
108,101-125,19,016-020,"Punk was washing up the dishes, grunting to himself under the lean-to of branches, where he later also slept"
45,051-075,9,009-010,"No one troubled to stir the slowly dying fire"
172,151-175,31,031-035,"Overhead the stars were brilliant in a sky quite wintry, and there was so little wind that ice was already forming stealthily along the shores of the still lake behind them"
73,076-010,12,011-015,"The silence of the vast listening forest stole forward and enveloped them"
43,051-075,8,006-008,"Hank broke in suddenly with his nasal voice"
108,101-125,18,016-020,"'I'm in favor of breaking new ground tomorrow, Doc,' he observed with energy, looking across at his employer"
48,051-075,9,009-010,"'We don't stand a dead Dago's chance around here"
50,051-075,9,009-010,"'Agreed,' said Cathcart, always a man of few words"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"'Think the idea's good"
51,051-075,8,006-008,"'Sure pop, it's good,' Hank resumed with confidence"
68,076-010,14,011-015,"'S'pose, now, you and I strike west, up Garden Lake way for a change"
53,051-075,12,011-015,"None of us ain't touched that quiet bit o' land yet '"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"'I'm with you"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"'And you, Défago, take Mr"
146,126-150,26,026-030,"Simpson along in the small canoe, skip across the lake, portage over into Fifty Island Water, and take a good squint down that thar southern shore"
118,101-125,25,021-025,"The moose 'yarded' there like hell last year, and for all we know they may be doin' it agin this year jest to spite us"
66,076-010,13,011-015,"Défago, keeping his eyes on the fire, said nothing by way of reply"
60,051-075,9,009-010,"He was still offended, possibly, about his interrupted story"
76,076-010,16,016-020,"'No one's been up that way this year, an' I'll lay my bottom dollar on _that"
66,076-010,13,011-015,"_' Hank added with emphasis, as though he had a reason for knowing"
37,026-050,7,006-008,"He looked over at his partner sharply"
127,126-150,22,021-025,"'Better take the little silk tent and stay away a couple o' nights,' he concluded, as though the matter were definitely settled"
84,076-010,16,016-020,"For Hank was recognized as general organizer of the hunt, and in charge of the party"
301,more,54,051-055,"It was obvious to anyone that Défago did not jump at the plan, but his silence seemed to convey something more than ordinary disapproval, and across his sensitive dark face there passed a curious expression like a flash of firelight not so quickly, however, that the three men had not time to catch it"
102,101-125,18,016-020,"'He funked for some reason, _I_ thought,' Simpson said afterwards in the tent he shared with his uncle"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Dr"
125,101-125,24,021-025,"Cathcart made no immediate reply, although the look had interested him enough at the time for him to make a mental note of it"
95,076-010,17,016-020,"The expression had caused him a passing uneasiness he could not quite account for at the moment"
184,176-200,36,036-040,"But Hank, of course, had been the first to notice it, and the odd thing was that instead of becoming explosive or angry over the other's reluctance, he at once began to humor him a bit"
153,151-175,29,026-030,"'But there ain't no _speshul_ reason why no one's been up there this year,' he said with a perceptible hush in his tone; 'not the reason you mean, anyway"
109,101-125,23,021-025,"Las' year it was the fires that kep' folks out, and this year I guess I guess it jest happened so, that's all"
46,051-075,8,006-008,"His manner was clearly meant to be encouraging"
63,076-010,11,011-015,"Joseph Défago raised his eyes a moment, then dropped them again"
84,076-010,17,016-020,"A breath of wind stole out of the forest and stirred the embers into a passing blaze"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Dr"
87,076-010,16,016-020,"Cathcart again noticed the expression in the guide's face, and again he did not like it"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"But this time the nature of the look betrayed itself"
83,076-010,18,016-020,"In those eyes, for an instant, he caught the gleam of a man scared in his very soul"
45,051-075,9,009-010,"It disquieted him more than he cared to admit"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"'Bad Indians up that way"
185,176-200,34,031-035,"he asked, with a laugh to ease matters a little, while Simpson, too sleepy to notice this subtle by-play, moved off to bed with a prodigious yawn; 'or or anything wrong with the country"
44,051-075,9,009-010,"he added, when his nephew was out of hearing"
61,051-075,11,011-015,"Hank met his eye with something less than his usual frankness"
47,051-075,6,006-008,"'He's jest skeered,' he replied good-humouredly"
40,026-050,7,006-008,"'Skeered stiff about some ole feery tale"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"That's all, ain't it, ole pard"
83,076-010,16,016-020,"And he gave Défago a friendly kick on the moccasined foot that lay nearest the fire"
138,126-150,24,021-025,"Défago looked up quickly, as from an interrupted reverie, a reverie, however, that had not prevented his seeing all that went on about him"
17,011-025,2,000-002,"'Skeered _nuthin'"
40,026-050,8,006-008,"_' he answered, with a flush of defiance"
82,076-010,15,011-015,"'There's nuthin' in the Bush that can skeer Joseph Défago, and don't you forget it"
122,101-125,25,021-025,"And the natural energy with which he spoke made it impossible to know whether he told the whole truth or only a part of it"
30,026-050,5,003-005,"Hank turned towards the doctor"
76,076-010,14,011-015,"He was just going to add something when he stopped abruptly and looked round"
62,076-010,12,011-015,"A sound close behind them in the darkness made all three start"
134,126-150,25,021-025,"It was old Punk, who had moved up from his lean-to while they talked and now stood there just beyond the circle of firelight listening"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"''Nother time, Doc"
81,076-010,14,011-015,"Hank whispered, with a wink, 'when the gallery ain't stepped down into the stalls"
135,126-150,28,026-030,"And, springing to his feet, he slapped the Indian on the back and cried noisily, 'Come up t' the fire an' warm yer dirty red skin a bit"
55,051-075,11,011-015,"He dragged him towards the blaze and threw more wood on"
261,251-275,50,046-050,"'That was a mighty good feed you give us an hour or two back,' he continued heartily, as though to set the man's thoughts on another scent, 'and it ain't Christian to let you stand out there freezin' yer ole soul to hell while we're gettin' all good an' toasted"
125,101-125,21,021-025,"Punk moved in and warmed his feet, smiling darkly at the other's volubility which he only half understood, but saying nothing"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"And presently Dr"
171,151-175,27,026-030,"Cathcart, seeing that further conversation was impossible, followed his nephew's example and moved off to the tent, leaving the three men smoking over the now blazing fire"
237,226-250,43,041-045,"It is not easy to undress in a small tent without waking one's companion, and Cathcart, hardened and warm-blooded as he was in spite of his fifty odd years, did what Hank would have described as 'considerable of his twilight' in the open"
208,201-225,37,036-040,"He noticed, during the process, that Punk had meanwhile gone back to his lean-to, and that Hank and Défago were at it hammer and tongs, or, rather, hammer and anvil, the little French Canadian being the anvil"
408,more,66,more,"It was all very like the conventional stage picture of Western melodrama: the fire lighting up their faces with patches of alternate red and black; Défago, in slouch hat and moccasins in the part of the 'badlands' villain; Hank, open-faced and hatless, with that reckless fling of his shoulders, the honest and deceived hero; and old Punk, eavesdropping in the background, supplying the atmosphere of mystery"
260,251-275,48,046-050,"The doctor smiled as he noticed the details; but at the same time something deep within him he hardly knew what shrank a little, as though an almost imperceptible breath of warning had touched the surface of his soul and was gone again before he could seize it"
180,176-200,30,026-030,"Probably it was traceable to that 'scared expression' he had seen in the eyes of Défago; 'probably' for this hint of fugitive emotion otherwise escaped his usually so keen analysis"
57,051-075,9,009-010,"Défago, he was vaguely aware, might cause trouble somehow"
50,051-075,11,011-015,"He was not as steady a guide as Hank, for instance"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"Further than that he could not get"
105,101-125,18,016-020,"He watched the men a moment longer before diving into the stuffy tent where Simpson already slept soundly"
112,101-125,22,021-025,"Hank, he saw, was swearing like a mad African in a New York nigger saloon; but it was the swearing of 'affection"
83,076-010,14,011-015,"The ridiculous oaths flew freely now that the cause of their obstruction was asleep"
156,151-175,25,021-025,"Presently he put his arm almost tenderly upon his comrade's shoulder, and they moved off together into the shadows where their tent stood faintly glimmering"
119,101-125,18,016-020,"Punk, too, a moment later followed their example and disappeared between his odorous blankets in the opposite direction"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Dr"
283,more,49,046-050,"Cathcart then likewise turned in, weariness and sleep still fighting in his mind with an obscure curiosity to know what it was that had scared Défago about the country up Fifty Island Water way, wondering, too, why Punk's presence had prevented the completion of what Hank had to say"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"Then sleep overtook him"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"He would know tomorrow"
72,076-010,13,011-015,"Hank would tell him the story while they trudged after the elusive moose"
99,076-010,17,016-020,"Deep silence fell about the little camp, planted there so audaciously in the jaws of the wilderness"
62,076-010,12,011-015,"The lake gleamed like a sheet of black glass beneath the stars"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"The cold air pricked"
218,201-225,38,036-040,"In the draughts of night that poured their silent tide from the depths of the forest, with messages from distant ridges and from lakes just beginning to freeze, there lay already the faint, bleak odors of coming winter"
214,201-225,37,036-040,"White men, with their dull scent, might never have divined them; the fragrance of the wood fire would have concealed from them these almost electrical hints of moss and bark and hardening swamp a hundred miles away"
138,126-150,25,021-025,"Even Hank and Défago, subtly in league with the soul of the woods as they were, would probably have spread their delicate nostrils in vain"
174,151-175,35,031-035,"But an hour later, when all slept like the dead, old Punk crept from his blankets and went down to the shore of the lake like a shadow silently, as only Indian blood can move"
39,026-050,8,006-008,"He raised his head and looked about him"
127,126-150,21,021-025,"The thick darkness rendered sight of small avail, but, like the animals, he possessed other senses that darkness could not mute"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"He listened then sniffed the air"
43,051-075,8,006-008,"Motionless as a hemlock stem he stood there"
75,076-010,14,011-015,"After five minutes again he lifted his head and sniffed, and yet once again"
115,101-125,22,021-025,"A tingling of the wonderful nerves that betrayed itself by no outer sign, ran through him as he tasted the keen air"
198,176-200,35,031-035,"Then, merging his figure into the surrounding blackness in a way that only wild men and animals understand, he turned, still moving like a shadow, and went stealthily back to his lean-to and his bed"
117,101-125,22,021-025,"And soon after he slept, the change of wind he had divined stirred gently the reflection of the stars within the lake"
266,251-275,50,046-050,"Rising among the far ridges of the country beyond Fifty Island Water, it came from the direction in which he had stared, and it passed over the sleeping camp with a faint and sighing murmur through the tops of the big trees that was almost too delicate to be audible"
225,201-225,36,036-040,"With it, down the desert paths of night, though too faint, too high even for the Indian's hair-like nerves, there passed a curious, thin odor, strangely disquieting, an odor of something that seemed unfamiliar utterly unknown"
132,126-150,24,021-025,"The French Canadian and the man of Indian blood each stirred uneasily in his sleep just about this time, though neither of them woke"
120,101-125,20,016-020,"Then the ghost of that unforgettably strange odor passed away and was lost among the leagues of tenantless forest beyond"
48,051-075,10,009-010,"In the morning the camp was astir before the sun"
74,076-010,16,016-020,"There had been a light fall of snow during the night and the air was sharp"
90,076-010,17,016-020,"Punk had done his duty betimes, for the odors of coffee and fried bacon reached every tent"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"All were in good spirits"
15,011-025,2,000-002,"'Wind's shifted"
85,076-010,13,011-015,"cried Hank vigorously, watching Simpson and his guide already loading the small canoe"
48,051-075,9,009-010,"'It's across the lake dead right for you fellers"
33,026-050,6,006-008,"And the snow'll make bully trails"
118,101-125,25,021-025,"If there's any moose mussing around up thar, they'll not get so much as a tail-end scent of you with the wind as it is"
26,026-050,4,003-005,"Good luck, Monsieur Défago"
87,076-010,13,011-015,"he added, facetiously giving the name its French pronunciation for once, '_bonne chance"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"_'"
88,076-010,15,011-015,"Défago returned the good wishes, apparently in the best of spirits, the silent mood gone"
278,more,52,051-055,"Before eight o'clock old Punk had the camp to himself, Cathcart and Hank were far along the trail that led westwards, while the canoe that carried Défago and Simpson, with silk tent and grub for two days, was already a dark speck bobbing on the bosom of the lake, going due east"
550,more,99,more,"The wintry sharpness of the air was tempered now by a sun that topped the wooded ridges and blazed with a luxurious warmth upon the world of lake and forest below; loons flew skimming through the sparkling spray that the wind lifted; divers shook their dripping heads to the sun and popped smartly out of sight again; and as far as eye could reach rose the leagues of endless, crowding Bush, desolate in its lonely sweep and grandeur, untrodden by foot of man, and stretching its mighty and unbroken carpet right up to the frozen shores of Hudson Bay"
131,126-150,26,026-030,"Simpson, who saw it all for the first time as he paddled hard in the bows of the dancing canoe, was enchanted by its austere beauty"
110,101-125,22,021-025,"His heart drank in the sense of freedom and great spaces just as his lungs drank in the cool and perfumed wind"
183,176-200,30,026-030,"Behind him in the stern seat, singing fragments of his native chanties, Défago steered the craft of birch bark like a thing of life, answering cheerfully all his companion's questions"
31,026-050,5,003-005,"Both were gay and light-hearted"
124,101-125,19,016-020,"On such occasions men lose the superficial, worldly distinctions; they become human beings working together for a common end"
127,126-150,20,016-020,"Simpson, the employer, and Défago the employed, among these primitive forces, were simply two men, the 'guider' and the 'guided"
133,126-150,19,016-020,"Superior knowledge, of course, assumed control, and the younger man fell without a second thought into the quasi-subordinate position"
57,051-075,10,009-010,"He never dreamed of objecting when Défago dropped the 'Mr"
184,176-200,32,031-035,",' and addressed him as 'Say, Simpson,' or 'Simpson, boss,' which was invariably the case before they reached the farther shore after a stiff paddle of twelve miles against a head wind"
62,076-010,13,011-015,"He only laughed, and liked it; then ceased to notice it at all"
245,226-250,44,041-045,"For this 'divinity student' was a young man of parts and character, though as yet, of course, untraveled; and on this trip the first time he had seen any country but his own and little Switzerland the huge scale of things somewhat bewildered him"
92,076-010,17,016-020,"It was one thing, he realized, to hear about primeval forests, but quite another to see them"
214,201-225,35,031-035,"While to dwell in them and seek acquaintance with their wild life was, again, an initiation that no intelligent man could undergo without a certain shifting of personal values hitherto held for permanent and sacred"
76,076-010,14,011-015,"Simpson knew the first faint indication of this emotion when he held the new"
79,076-010,14,011-015,"303 rifle in his hands and looked along its pair of faultless, gleaming barrels"
107,101-125,18,016-020,"The three days' journey to their headquarters, by lake and portage, had carried the process a stage farther"
303,more,54,051-055,"And now that he was about to plunge beyond even the fringe of wilderness where they were camped into the virgin heart of uninhabited regions as vast as Europe itself, the true nature of the situation stole upon him with an effect of delight and awe that his imagination was fully capable of appreciating"
71,076-010,13,011-015,"It was himself and Défago against a multitude at least, against a Titan"
114,101-125,19,016-020,"The bleak splendors of these remote and lonely forests rather overwhelmed him with the sense of his own littleness"
178,176-200,30,026-030,"That stern quality of the tangled backwoods which can only be described as merciless and terrible, rose out of these far blue woods swimming upon the horizon, and revealed itself"
32,026-050,5,003-005,"He understood the silent warning"
38,026-050,6,006-008,"He realized his own utter helplessness"
140,126-150,24,021-025,"Only Défago, as a symbol of a distant civilization where man was master, stood between him and a pitiless death by exhaustion and starvation"
427,more,76,more,"It was thrilling to him, therefore, to watch Défago turn over the canoe upon the shore, pack the paddles carefully underneath, and then proceed to 'blaze' the spruce stems for some distance on either side of an almost invisible trail, with the careless remark thrown in, 'Say, Simpson, if anything happens to me, you'll find the canoe all correc' by these marks; then strike doo west into the sun to hit the home camp agin, see"
274,251-275,52,051-055,"It was the most natural thing in the world to say, and he said it without any noticeable inflexion of the voice, only it happened to express the youth's emotions at the moment with an utterance that was symbolic of the situation and of his own helplessness as a factor in it"
59,051-075,12,011-015,"He was alone with Défago in a primitive world: that was all"
72,076-010,13,011-015,"The canoe, another symbol of man's ascendancy, was now to be left behind"
103,101-125,19,016-020,"Those small yellow patches, made on the trees by the axe, were the only indications of its hiding place"
462,more,74,more,"Meanwhile, shouldering the packs between them, each man carrying his own rifle, they followed the slender trail over rocks and fallen trunks and across half-frozen swamps; skirting numerous lakes that fairly gemmed the forest, their borders fringed with mist; and towards five o'clock found themselves suddenly on the edge of the woods, looking out across a large sheet of water in front of them, dotted with pine-clad islands of all describable shapes and sizes"
71,076-010,11,011-015,"'Fifty Island Water,' announced Défago wearily, 'and the sun jest goin'"
32,026-050,8,006-008,"to dip his bald old head into it"
93,076-010,15,011-015,"he added, with unconscious poetry; and immediately they set about pitching camp for the night"
241,226-250,46,046-050,"In a very few minutes, under those skilful hands that never made a movement too much or a movement too little, the silk tent stood taut and cozy, the beds of balsam boughs ready laid, and a brisk cooking fire burned with the minimum of smoke"
180,176-200,31,031-035,"While the young Scotchman cleaned the fish they had caught trolling behind the canoe, Défago 'guessed' he would 'jest as soon' take a turn through the Bush for indications of moose"
147,126-150,30,026-030,"'_May_ come across a trunk where they bin and rubbed horns,' he said, as he moved off, 'or feedin' on the last of the maple leaves' and he was gone"
149,126-150,27,026-030,"His small figure melted away like a shadow in the dusk, while Simpson noted with a kind of admiration how easily the forest absorbed him into herself"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"A few steps, it seemed, and he was no longer visible"
209,201-225,33,031-035,"Yet there was little underbrush hereabouts; the trees stood somewhat apart, well spaced; and in the clearings grew silver birch and maple, spearlike and slender, against the immense stems of spruce and hemlock"
189,176-200,35,031-035,"But for occasional prostrate monsters, and the boulders of grey rock that thrust uncouth shoulders here and there out of the ground, it might well have been a bit of park in the Old Country"
49,051-075,11,011-015,"Almost, one might have seen in it the hand of man"
346,more,59,056-060,"A little to the right, however, began the great burnt section, miles in extent, proclaiming its real character _brulé_, as it is called, where the fires of the previous year had raged for weeks, and the blackened stumps now rose gaunt and ugly, bereft of branches, like gigantic match heads stuck into the ground, savage and desolate beyond words"
73,076-010,12,011-015,"The perfume of charcoal and rain-soaked ashes still hung faintly about it"
159,151-175,29,026-030,"The dusk rapidly deepened; the glades grew dark; the crackling of the fire and the wash of little waves along the rocky lake shore were the only sounds audible"
89,076-010,17,016-020,"The wind had dropped with the sun, and in all that vast world of branches nothing stirred"
158,151-175,26,026-030,"Any moment, it seemed, the woodland gods, who are to be worshipped in silence and loneliness, might stretch their mighty and terrific outlines among the trees"
210,201-225,35,031-035,"In front, through doorways pillared by huge straight stems, lay the stretch of Fifty Island Water, a crescent-shaped lake some fifteen miles from tip to tip, and perhaps five miles across where they were camped"
248,226-250,42,041-045,"A sky of rose and saffron, more clear than any atmosphere Simpson had ever known, still dropped its pale streaming fires across the waves, where the islands a hundred, surely, rather than fifty floated like the fairy barques of some enchanted fleet"
241,226-250,41,041-045,"Fringed with pines, whose crests fingered most delicately the sky, they almost seemed to move upwards as the light faded about to weigh anchor and navigate the pathways of the heavens instead of the currents of their native and desolate lake"
90,076-010,14,011-015,"And strips of colored cloud, like flaunting pennons, signaled their departure to the stars"
47,051-075,8,006-008,"The beauty of the scene was strangely uplifting"
143,126-150,29,026-030,"Simpson smoked the fish and burnt his fingers into the bargain in his efforts to enjoy it and at the same time tend the frying pan and the fire"
172,151-175,31,031-035,"Yet, ever at the back of his thoughts, lay that other aspect of the wilderness: the indifference to human life, the merciless spirit of desolation which took no note of man"
165,151-175,29,026-030,"The sense of his utter loneliness, now that even Défago had gone, came close as he looked about him and listened for the sound of his companion's returning footsteps"
81,076-010,13,011-015,"There was pleasure in the sensation, yet with it a perfectly comprehensible alarm"
45,051-075,7,006-008,"And instinctively the thought stirred in him:"
74,076-010,15,011-015,"'What should I _could_ I, do if anything happened and he did not come back"
199,176-200,33,031-035,"They enjoyed their well-earned supper, eating untold quantities of fish, and drinking unmilked tea strong enough to kill men who had not covered thirty miles of hard 'going,' eating little on the way"
144,126-150,24,021-025,"And when it was over, they smoked and told stories round the blazing fire, laughing, stretching weary limbs, and discussing plans for the morrow"
90,076-010,15,011-015,"Défago was in excellent spirits, though disappointed at having no signs of moose to report"
39,026-050,10,009-010,"But it was dark and he had not gone far"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"The _brulé_, too, was bad"
48,051-075,8,006-008,"His clothes and hands were smeared with charcoal"
102,101-125,14,011-015,"Simpson, watching him, realized with renewed vividness their position alone together in the wilderness"
126,126-150,25,021-025,"'Défago,' he said presently, 'these woods, you know, are a bit too big to feel quite at home in to feel comfortable in, I mean"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Eh"
149,126-150,27,026-030,"He merely gave expression to the mood of the moment; he was hardly prepared for the earnestness, the solemnity even, with which the guide took him up"
122,101-125,21,021-025,"'You've hit it right, Simpson, boss,' he replied, fixing his searching brown eyes on his face, 'and that's the truth, sure"
35,026-050,9,009-010,"There's no end to 'em no end at all"
106,101-125,21,021-025,"Then he added in a lowered tone as if to himself, 'There's lots found out _that_, and gone plumb to pieces"
170,151-175,32,031-035,"But the man's gravity of manner was not quite to the other's liking; it was a little too suggestive for this scenery and setting; he was sorry he had broached the subject"
259,251-275,43,041-045,"He remembered suddenly how his uncle had told him that men were sometimes stricken with a strange fever of the wilderness, when the seduction of the uninhabited wastes caught them so fiercely that they went forth, half fascinated, half deluded, to their death"
91,076-010,17,016-020,"And he had a shrewd idea that his companion held something in sympathy with that queer type"
154,151-175,30,026-030,"He led the conversation on to other topics, on to Hank and the doctor, for instance, and the natural rivalry as to who should get the first sight of moose"
171,151-175,29,026-030,"'If they went doo west,' observed Défago carelessly, 'there's sixty miles between us now with ole Punk at halfway house eatin' himself full to bustin' with fish and coffee"
38,026-050,6,006-008,"They laughed together over the picture"
188,176-200,34,031-035,"But the casual mention of those sixty miles again made Simpson realize the prodigious scale of this land where they hunted; sixty miles was a mere step; two hundred little more than a step"
59,051-075,9,009-010,"Stories of lost hunters rose persistently before his memory"
149,126-150,28,026-030,"The passion and mystery of homeless and wandering men, seduced by the beauty of great forests, swept his soul in a way too vivid to be quite pleasant"
120,101-125,19,016-020,"He wondered vaguely whether it was the mood of his companion that invited the unwelcome suggestion with such persistence"
120,101-125,23,021-025,"'Sing us a song, Défago, if you're not too tired,' he asked; 'one of those old _voyageur_ songs you sang the other night"
262,251-275,45,041-045,"He handed his tobacco pouch to the guide and then filled his own pipe, while the Canadian, nothing loth, sent his light voice across the lake in one of those plaintive, almost melancholy chanties with which lumbermen and trappers lessen the burden of their labor"
233,226-250,38,036-040,"There was an appealing and romantic flavor about it, something that recalled the atmosphere of the old pioneer days when Indians and wilderness were leagued together, battles frequent, and the Old Country farther off than it is today"
162,151-175,28,026-030,"The sound traveled pleasantly over the water, but the forest at their backs seemed to swallow it down with a single gulp that permitted neither echo nor resonance"
151,151-175,26,026-030,"It was in the middle of the third verse that Simpson noticed something unusual something that brought his thoughts back with a rush from faraway scenes"
46,051-075,9,009-010,"A curious change had come into the man's voice"
194,176-200,35,031-035,"Even before he knew what it was, uneasiness caught him, and looking up quickly, he saw that Défago, though still singing, was peering about him into the Bush, as though he heard or saw something"
63,076-010,11,011-015,"His voice grew fainter dropped to a hush then ceased altogether"
110,101-125,19,016-020,"The same instant, with a movement amazingly alert, he started to his feet and stood upright _sniffing the air_"
186,176-200,33,031-035,"Like a dog scenting game, he drew the air into his nostrils in short, sharp breaths, turning quickly as he did so in all directions, and finally 'pointing' down the lake shore, eastwards"
85,076-010,13,011-015,"It was a performance unpleasantly suggestive and at the same time singularly dramatic"
55,051-075,8,006-008,"Simpson's heart fluttered disagreeably as he watched it"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"'Lord, man"
20,011-025,5,003-005,"How you made me jump"
109,101-125,20,016-020,"he exclaimed, on his feet beside him the same instant, and peering over his shoulder into the sea of darkness"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"'What's up"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"Are you frightened"
181,176-200,38,036-040,"Even before the question was out of his mouth he knew it was foolish, for any man with a pair of eyes in his head could see that the Canadian had turned white down to his very gills"
58,051-075,12,011-015,"Not even sunburn and the glare of the fire could hide that"
65,076-010,11,011-015,"The student felt himself trembling a little, weakish in the knees"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"'What's up"
19,011-025,3,003-005,"he repeated quickly"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"'D'you smell moose"
33,026-050,5,003-005,"Or anything queer, anything wrong"
34,026-050,5,003-005,"He lowered his voice instinctively"
187,176-200,33,031-035,"The forest pressed round them with its encircling wall; the nearer tree stems gleamed like bronze in the firelight; beyond that blackness, and, so far as he could tell, a silence of death"
147,126-150,28,026-030,"Just behind them a passing puff of wind lifted a single leaf, looked at it, then laid it softly down again without disturbing the rest of the covey"
98,076-010,17,016-020,"It seemed as if a million invisible causes had combined just to produce that single visible effect"
43,051-075,8,006-008,"_Other_ life pulsed about them and was gone"
76,076-010,15,011-015,"Défago turned abruptly; the livid hue of his face had turned to a dirty grey"
142,126-150,25,021-025,"'I never said I heered or smelt nuthin',' he said slowly and emphatically, in an oddly altered voice that conveyed somehow a touch of defiance"
43,051-075,10,009-010,"'I was only takin' a look round so to speak"
59,051-075,11,011-015,"It's always a mistake to be too previous with yer questions"
110,101-125,19,016-020,"Then he added suddenly with obvious effort, in his more natural voice, 'Have you got the matches, Boss Simpson"
79,076-010,16,016-020,"and proceeded to light the pipe he had half filled just before he began to sing"
61,051-075,11,011-015,"Without speaking another word they sat down again by the fire"
79,076-010,15,011-015,"Défago changing his side so that he could face the direction the wind came from"
37,026-050,7,006-008,"For even a tenderfoot could tell that"
90,076-010,18,016-020,"Défago changed his position in order to hear and smell all there was to be heard and smelt"
178,176-200,34,031-035,"And, since he now faced the lake with his back to the trees it was evidently nothing in the forest that had sent so strange and sudden a warning to his marvelously trained nerves"
83,076-010,15,011-015,"'Guess now I don't feel like singing any,' he explained presently of his own accord"
92,076-010,15,011-015,"'That song kinder brings back memories that's troublesome to me; I never oughter've begun it"
38,026-050,8,006-008,"It sets me on t' imagining things, see"
70,076-010,11,011-015,"Clearly the man was still fighting with some profoundly moving emotion"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"He wished to excuse himself in the eyes of the other"
135,126-150,28,026-030,"But the explanation, in that it was only a part of the truth, was a lie, and he knew perfectly well that Simpson was not deceived by it"
116,101-125,21,021-025,"For nothing could explain away the livid terror that had dropped over his face while he stood there sniffing the air"
122,101-125,22,021-025,"And nothing no amount of blazing fire, or chatting on ordinary subjects could make that camp exactly as it had been before"
207,201-225,35,031-035,"The shadow of an unknown horror, naked if unguessed, that had flashed for an instant in the face and gestures of the guide, had also communicated itself, vaguely and therefore more potently, to his companion"
73,076-010,12,011-015,"The guide's visible efforts to dissemble the truth only made things worse"
169,151-175,28,026-030,"Moreover, to add to the younger man's uneasiness, was the difficulty, nay, the impossibility he felt of asking questions, and also his complete ignorance as to the cause"
87,076-010,15,011-015,"Indians, wild animals, forest fires all these, he knew, were wholly out of the question"
48,051-075,7,006-008,"His imagination searched vigorously, but in vain"
189,176-200,31,031-035,"Yet, somehow or other, after another long spell of smoking, talking and roasting themselves before the great fire, the shadow that had so suddenly invaded their peaceful camp began to shift"
259,251-275,42,041-045,"Perhaps Défago's efforts, or the return of his quiet and normal attitude accomplished this; perhaps Simpson himself had exaggerated the affair out of all proportion to the truth; or possibly the vigorous air of the wilderness brought its own powers of healing"
142,126-150,25,021-025,"Whatever the cause, the feeling of immediate horror seemed to have passed away as mysteriously as it had come, for nothing occurred to feed it"
85,076-010,15,011-015,"Simpson began to feel that he had permitted himself the unreasoning terror of a child"
176,176-200,30,026-030,"He put it down partly to a certain subconscious excitement that this wild and immense scenery generated in his blood, partly to the spell of solitude, and partly to overfatigue"
166,151-175,31,031-035,"That pallor in the guide's face was, of course, uncommonly hard to explain, yet it _might_ have been due in some way to an effect of firelight, or his own imagination"
50,051-075,11,011-015,"He gave it the benefit of the doubt; he was Scotch"
116,101-125,19,016-020,"When a somewhat unordinary emotion has disappeared, the mind always finds a dozen ways of explaining away its causes"
53,051-075,11,011-015,"Simpson lit a last pipe and tried to laugh to himself"
60,051-075,12,011-015,"On getting home to Scotland it would make quite a good story"
241,226-250,46,046-050,"He did not realize that this laughter was a sign that terror still lurked in the recesses of his soul that, in fact, it was merely one of the conventional signs by which a man, seriously alarmed, tries to persuade himself that he is _not_ so"
80,076-010,14,011-015,"Défago, however, heard that low laughter and looked up with surprise on his face"
77,076-010,15,011-015,"The two men stood, side by side, kicking the embers about before going to bed"
60,051-075,13,011-015,"It was ten o'clock a late hour for hunters to be still awake"
20,011-025,3,003-005,"'What's ticklin' yer"
42,051-075,8,006-008,"he asked in his ordinary tone, yet gravely"
253,251-275,47,046-050,"'I I was thinking of our little toy woods at home, just at that moment,' stammered Simpson, coming back to what really dominated his mind, and startled by the question, 'and comparing them to to all this,' and he swept his arm round to indicate the Bush"
55,051-075,10,009-010,"A pause followed in which neither of them said anything"
118,101-125,21,021-025,"'All the same I wouldn't laugh about it, if I was you,' Défago added, looking over Simpson's shoulder into the shadows"
92,076-010,16,016-020,"'There's places in there nobody won't never see into nobody knows what lives in there either"
20,011-025,5,003-005,"'Too big too far off"
61,051-075,10,009-010,"The suggestion in the guide's manner was immense and horrible"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"Défago nodded"
35,026-050,7,006-008,"The expression on his face was dark"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"He, too, felt uneasy"
159,151-175,31,031-035,"The younger man understood that in a _hinterland_ of this size there might well be depths of wood that would never in the life of the world be known or trodden"
48,051-075,9,009-010,"The thought was not exactly the sort he welcomed"
66,076-010,13,011-015,"In a loud voice, cheerfully, he suggested that it was time for bed"
133,126-150,22,021-025,"But the guide lingered, tinkering with the fire, arranging the stones needlessly, doing a dozen things that did not really need doing"
81,076-010,15,011-015,"Evidently there was something he wanted to say, yet found it difficult to 'get at"
155,151-175,28,026-030,"'Say, you, Boss Simpson,' he began suddenly, as the last shower of sparks went up into the air, 'you don't smell nothing, do you nothing pertickler, I mean"
91,076-010,13,011-015,"The commonplace question, Simpson realized, veiled a dreadfully serious thought in his mind"
26,026-050,6,006-008,"A shiver ran down his back"
74,076-010,12,011-015,"'Nothing but burning wood,' he replied firmly, kicking again at the embers"
40,026-050,9,009-010,"The sound of his own foot made him start"
44,051-075,8,006-008,"'And all the evenin' you ain't smelt nothing"
128,126-150,20,016-020,"persisted the guide, peering at him through the gloom; 'nothing extrordiny, and different to anything else you ever smelt before"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"'No, no, man; nothing at all"
37,026-050,5,003-005,"he replied aggressively, half angrily"
21,011-025,3,003-005,"Défago's face cleared"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"'That's good"
32,026-050,5,003-005,"he exclaimed with evident relief"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"'That's good to hear"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"'Have _you"
69,076-010,11,011-015,"_' asked Simpson sharply, and the same instant regretted the question"
40,026-050,7,006-008,"The Canadian came closer in the darkness"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"He shook his head"
62,076-010,9,009-010,"'I guess not,' he said, though without overwhelming conviction"
51,051-075,11,011-015,"'It must've been just that song of mine that did it"
157,151-175,26,026-030,"It's the song they sing in lumber camps and godforsaken places like that, when they're skeered the Wendigo's somewhere around, doin' a bit of swift traveling"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"'"
29,026-050,5,003-005,"'And what's the Wendigo, pray"
100,076-010,16,016-020,"Simpson asked quickly, irritated because again he could not prevent that sudden shiver of the nerves"
67,076-010,15,011-015,"He knew that he was close upon the man's terror and the cause of it"
77,076-010,12,011-015,"Yet a rushing passionate curiosity overcame his better judgment, and his fear"
82,076-010,15,011-015,"Défago turned swiftly and looked at him as though he were suddenly about to shriek"
43,051-075,9,009-010,"His eyes shone, but his mouth was wide open"
384,more,70,more,"Yet all he said, or whispered rather, for his voice sank very low, was: 'It's nuthin' nuthin' but what those lousy fellers believe when they've bin hittin' the bottle too long a sort of great animal that lives up yonder,' he jerked his head northwards, 'quick as lightning in its tracks, an' bigger'n anything else in the Bush, an' ain't supposed to be very good to look at that's all"
139,126-150,25,021-025,"'A backwoods superstition ' began Simpson, moving hastily toward the tent in order to shake off the hand of the guide that clutched his arm"
63,076-010,12,011-015,"'Come, come, hurry up for God's sake, and get the lantern going"
81,076-010,18,016-020,"It's time we were in bed and asleep if we're going to be up with the sun tomorrow"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"The guide was close on his heels"
58,051-075,10,009-010,"'I'm coming,' he answered out of the darkness, 'I'm coming"
107,101-125,23,021-025,"And after a slight delay he appeared with the lantern and hung it from a nail in the front pole of the tent"
191,176-200,36,036-040,"The shadows of a hundred trees shifted their places quickly as he did so, and when he stumbled over the rope, diving swiftly inside, the whole tent trembled as though a gust of wind struck it"
99,076-010,16,016-020,"The two men lay down, without undressing, upon their beds of soft balsam boughs, cunningly arranged"
240,226-250,40,036-040,"Inside, all was warm and cozy, but outside the world of crowding trees pressed close about them, marshalling their million shadows, and smothering the little tent that stood there like a wee white shell facing the ocean of tremendous forest"
115,101-125,19,016-020,"Between the two lonely figures within, however, there pressed another shadow that was _not_ a shadow from the night"
133,126-150,24,021-025,"It was the Shadow cast by the strange Fear, never wholly exorcised, that had leaped suddenly upon Défago in the middle of his singing"
222,201-225,40,036-040,"And Simpson, as he lay there, watching the darkness through the open flap of the tent, ready to plunge into the fragrant abyss of sleep, knew first that unique and profound stillness of a primeval forest when no wind stirs"
93,076-010,19,016-020,"and when the night has weight and substance that enters into the soul to bind a veil about it"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"Then sleep took him"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"Thus, it seemed to him, at least"
291,more,53,051-055,"Yet it was true that the lap of the water, just beyond the tent door, still beat time with his lessening pulses when he realized that he was lying with his eyes open and that another sound had recently introduced itself with cunning softness between the splash and murmur of the little waves"
103,101-125,20,016-020,"And, long before he understood what this sound was, it had stirred in him the centers of pity and alarm"
111,101-125,21,021-025,"He listened intently, though at first in vain, for the running blood beat all its drums too noisily in his ears"
58,051-075,12,011-015,"Did it come, he wondered, from the lake, or from the woods"
201,201-225,39,036-040,"Then, suddenly, with a rush and a flutter of the heart, he knew that it was close beside him in the tent; and, when he turned over for a better hearing, it focused itself unmistakably not two feet away"
181,176-200,33,031-035,"It was a sound of weeping; Défago upon his bed of branches was sobbing in the darkness as though his heart would break, the blankets evidently stuffed against his mouth to stifle it"
108,101-125,19,016-020,"And his first feeling, before he could think or reflect, was the rush of a poignant and searching tenderness"
75,076-010,12,011-015,"This intimate, human sound, heard amid the desolation about them, woke pity"
59,051-075,10,009-010,"It was so incongruous, so pitifully incongruous and so vain"
54,051-075,10,009-010,"Tears in this vast and cruel wilderness: of what avail"
51,051-075,9,009-010,"He thought of a little child crying in mid-Atlantic"
145,126-150,27,026-030,"Then, of course, with fuller realization, and the memory of what had gone before, came the descent of the terror upon him, and his blood ran cold"
50,051-075,7,006-008,"'Défago,' he whispered quickly, 'what's the matter"
38,026-050,8,006-008,"He tried to make his voice very gentle"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"'Are you in pain unhappy"
50,051-075,9,009-010,"There was no reply, but the sounds ceased abruptly"
41,051-075,8,006-008,"He stretched his hand out and touched him"
21,011-025,5,003-005,"The body did not stir"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"'Are you awake"
59,051-075,13,011-015,"for it occurred to him that the man was crying in his sleep"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"'Are you cold"
86,076-010,15,011-015,"He noticed that his feet, which were uncovered, projected beyond the mouth of the tent"
53,051-075,11,011-015,"He spread an extra fold of his own blankets over them"
92,076-010,18,016-020,"The guide had slipped down in his bed, and the branches seemed to have been dragged with him"
65,076-010,14,011-015,"He was afraid to pull the body back again, for fear of waking him"
137,126-150,24,021-025,"One or two tentative questions he ventured softly, but though he waited for several minutes there came no reply, nor any sign of movement"
138,126-150,24,021-025,"Presently he heard his regular and quiet breathing, and putting his hand again gently on the breast, felt the steady rise and fall beneath"
73,076-010,14,011-015,"'Let me know if anything's wrong,' he whispered, 'or if I can do anything"
33,026-050,8,006-008,"Wake me at once if you feel queer"
26,026-050,6,006-008,"He hardly knew what to say"
59,051-075,11,011-015,"He lay down again, thinking and wondering what it all meant"
47,051-075,9,009-010,"Défago, of course, had been crying in his sleep"
37,026-050,7,006-008,"Some dream or other had afflicted him"
134,126-150,24,021-025,"Yet never in his life would he forget that pitiful sound of sobbing, and the feeling that the whole awful wilderness of woods listened"
288,more,44,041-045,"His own mind busied itself for a long time with the recent events, of which _this_ took its mysterious place as one, and though his reason successfully argued away all unwelcome suggestions, a sensation of uneasiness remained, resisting ejection, very deep-seated peculiar beyond ordinary"
60,051-075,11,011-015,"But sleep, in the long run, proves greater than all emotions"
153,151-175,25,021-025,"His thoughts soon wandered again; he lay there, warm as toast, exceedingly weary; the night soothed and comforted, blunting the edges of memory and alarm"
78,076-010,15,011-015,"Half an hour later he was oblivious of everything in the outer world about him"
109,101-125,18,016-020,"Yet sleep, in this case, was his great enemy, concealing all approaches, smothering the warning of his nerves"
429,more,67,more,"As, sometimes, in a nightmare events crowd upon each other's heels with a conviction of dreadfulest reality, yet some inconsistent detail accuses the whole display of incompleteness and disguise, so the events that now followed, though they actually happened, persuaded the mind somehow that the detail which could explain them had been overlooked in the confusion, and that therefore they were but partly true, the rest delusion"
89,076-010,16,016-020,"At the back of the sleeper's mind something remains awake, ready to let slip the judgment"
65,076-010,12,011-015,"'All this is not _quite_ real; when you wake up you'll understand"
39,026-050,9,009-010,"And thus, in a way, it was with Simpson"
246,226-250,42,041-045,"The events, not wholly inexplicable or incredible in themselves, yet remain for the man who saw and heard them a sequence of separate facts of cold horror, because the little piece that might have made the puzzle clear lay concealed or overlooked"
208,201-225,37,036-040,"So far as he can recall, it was a violent movement, running downwards through the tent towards the door, that first woke him and made him aware that his companion was sitting bolt upright beside him quivering"
106,101-125,20,016-020,"Hours must have passed, for it was the pale gleam of the dawn that revealed his outline against the canvas"
151,151-175,29,026-030,"This time the man was not crying; he was quaking like a leaf; the trembling he felt plainly through the blankets down the entire length of his own body"
153,151-175,24,021-025,"Défago had huddled down against him for protection, shrinking away from something that apparently concealed itself near the door flaps of the little tent"
163,151-175,30,026-030,"Simpson thereupon called out in a loud voice some question or other in the first bewilderment of waking he does not remember exactly what and the man made no reply"
110,101-125,17,016-020,"The atmosphere and feeling of true nightmare lay horribly about him, making movement and speech both difficult"
117,101-125,25,021-025,"At first, indeed, he was not sure where he was whether in one of the earlier camps, or at home in his bed at Aberdeen"
41,051-075,7,006-008,"The sense of confusion was very troubling"
137,126-150,23,021-025,"And next almost simultaneous with his waking, it seemed the profound stillness of the dawn outside was shattered by a most uncommon sound"
77,076-010,12,011-015,"It came without warning, or audible approach; and it was unspeakably dreadful"
248,226-250,40,036-040,"It was a voice, Simpson declares, possibly a human voice; hoarse yet plaintive a soft, roaring voice close outside the tent, overhead rather than upon the ground, of immense volume, while in some strange way most penetratingly and seductively sweet"
176,176-200,30,026-030,"It rang out, too, in three separate and distinct notes, or cries, that bore in some odd fashion a resemblance, farfetched yet recognizable, to the name of the guide: '_Dé-fa-go"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"_'"
177,176-200,32,031-035,"The student admits he is unable to describe it quite intelligently, for it was unlike any sound he had ever heard in his life, and combined a blending of such contrary qualities"
111,101-125,20,016-020,"'A sort of windy, crying voice,' he calls it, 'as of something lonely and untamed, wild and of abominable power"
162,151-175,28,026-030,"And, even before it ceased, dropping back into the great gulfs of silence, the guide beside him had sprung to his feet with an answering though unintelligible cry"
191,176-200,30,026-030,"He blundered against the tent pole with violence, shaking the whole structure, spreading his arms out frantically for more room, and kicking his legs impetuously free of the clinging blankets"
257,251-275,49,046-050,"For a second, perhaps two, he stood upright by the door, his outline dark against the pallor of the dawn; then, with a furious, rushing speed, before his companion could move a hand to stop him, he shot with a plunge through the flaps of canvas and was gone"
229,226-250,40,036-040,"And as he went so astonishingly fast that the voice could actually be heard dying in the distance he called aloud in tones of anguished terror that at the same time held something strangely like the frenzied exultation of delight"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"'Oh"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"oh"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"My feet of fire"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"My burning feet of fire"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Oh"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"oh"
27,026-050,5,003-005,"This height and fiery speed"
119,101-125,21,021-025,"And then the distance quickly buried it, and the deep silence of very early morning descended upon the forest as before"
197,176-200,37,036-040,"It had all come about with such rapidity that, but for the evidence of the empty bed beside him, Simpson could almost have believed it to have been the memory of a nightmare carried over from sleep"
186,176-200,33,031-035,"He still felt the warm pressure of that vanished body against his side; there lay the twisted blankets in a heap; the very tent yet trembled with the vehemence of the impetuous departure"
123,101-125,23,021-025,"The strange words rang in his ears, as though he still heard them in the distance wild language of a suddenly stricken mind"
236,226-250,43,041-045,"Moreover, it was not only the senses of sight and hearing that reported uncommon things to his brain, for even while the man cried and ran, he had become aware that a strange perfume, faint yet pungent, pervaded the interior of the tent"
216,201-225,39,036-040,"And it was at this point, it seems, brought to himself by the consciousness that his nostrils were taking this distressing odor down into his throat, that he found his courage, sprang quickly to his feet and went out"
109,101-125,18,016-020,"The grey light of dawn that dropped, cold and glimmering, between the trees revealed the scene tolerably well"
305,more,56,056-060,"There stood the tent behind him, soaked with dew; the dark ashes of the fire, still warm; the lake, white beneath a coating of mist, the islands rising darkly out of it like objects packed in wool; and patches of snow beyond among the clearer spaces of the Bush everything cold, still, waiting for the sun"
107,101-125,18,016-020,"But nowhere a sign of the vanished guide still, doubtless, flying at frantic speed through the frozen woods"
89,076-010,16,016-020,"There was not even the sound of disappearing footsteps, nor the echoes of the dying voice"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"He had gone utterly"
147,126-150,23,021-025,"There was nothing; nothing but the sense of his recent presence, so strongly left behind about the camp; _and_ this penetrating, all-pervading odor"
54,051-075,10,009-010,"And even this was now rapidly disappearing in its turn"
230,226-250,38,036-040,"In spite of his exceeding mental perturbation, Simpson struggled hard to detect its nature, and define it, but the ascertaining of an elusive scent, not recognized subconsciously and at once, is a very subtle operation of the mind"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"And he failed"
53,051-075,11,011-015,"It was gone before he could properly seize or name it"
96,076-010,16,016-020,"Approximate description, even, seems to have been difficult, for it was unlike any smell he knew"
264,251-275,48,046-050,"Acrid rather, not unlike the odor of a lion, he thinks, yet softer and not wholly unpleasing, with something almost sweet in it that reminded him of the scent of decaying garden leaves, earth, and the myriad, nameless perfumes that make up the odor of a big forest"
74,076-010,16,016-020,"Yet the 'odor of lions' is the phrase with which he usually sums it all up"
186,176-200,36,036-040,"Then it was wholly gone, and he found himself standing by the ashes of the fire in a state of amazement and stupid terror that left him the helpless prey of anything that chose to happen"
180,176-200,34,031-035,"Had a muskrat poked its pointed muzzle over a rock, or a squirrel scuttled in that instant down the bark of a tree, he would most likely have collapsed without more ado and fainted"
78,076-010,15,011-015,"For he felt about the whole affair the touch somewhere of a great Outer Horror"
120,101-125,20,016-020,"and his scattered powers had not as yet had time to collect themselves into a definite attitude of fighting self-control"
27,026-050,4,003-005,"Nothing did happen, however"
128,126-150,23,021-025,"A great kiss of wind ran softly through the awakening forest, and a few maple leaves here and there rustled tremblingly to earth"
44,051-075,8,006-008,"The sky seemed to grow suddenly much lighter"
274,251-275,50,046-050,"Simpson felt the cool air upon his cheek and uncovered head; realized that he was shivering with the cold; and, making a great effort, realized next that he was alone in the Bush _and_ that he was called upon to take immediate steps to find and succor his vanished companion"
76,076-010,12,011-015,"Make an effort, accordingly, he did, though an ill-calculated and futile one"
335,more,60,056-060,"With that wilderness of trees about him, the sheet of water cutting him off behind, and the horror of that wild cry in his blood, he did what any other inexperienced man would have done in similar bewilderment: he ran about, without any sense of direction, like a frantic child, and called loudly without ceasing the name of the guide:"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"'Défago"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Défago"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Défago"
102,101-125,20,016-020,"he yelled, and the trees gave him back the name as often as he shouted, only a little softened 'Défago"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Défago"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Défago"
147,126-150,29,026-030,"He followed the trail that lay a short distance across the patches of snow, and then lost it again where the trees grew too thickly for snow to lie"
132,126-150,25,021-025,"He shouted till he was hoarse, and till the sound of his own voice in all that unanswering and listening world began to frighten him"
70,076-010,12,011-015,"His confusion increased in direct ratio to the violence of his efforts"
152,151-175,25,021-025,"His distress became formidably acute, till at length his exertions defeated their own object, and from sheer exhaustion he headed back to the camp again"
46,051-075,10,009-010,"It remains a wonder that he ever found his way"
144,126-150,26,026-030,"It was with great difficulty, and only after numberless false clues, that he at last saw the white tent between the trees, and so reached safety"
58,051-075,10,009-010,"Exhaustion then applied its own remedy, and he grew calmer"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"He made the fire and breakfasted"
121,101-125,24,021-025,"Hot coffee and bacon put a little sense and judgment into him again, and he realized that he had been behaving like a boy"
307,more,55,051-055,"He now made another, and more successful attempt to face the situation collectedly, and, a nature naturally plucky coming to his assistance, he decided that he must first make as thorough a search as possible, failing success in which, he must find his way into the home camp as best he could and bring help"
24,026-050,6,006-008,"And this was what he did"
116,101-125,22,021-025,"Taking food, matches and rifle with him, and a small axe to blaze the trees against his return journey, he set forth"
104,101-125,21,021-025,"It was eight o'clock when he started, the sun shining over the tops of the trees in a sky without clouds"
86,076-010,19,016-020,"Pinned to a stake by the fire he left a note in case Défago returned while he was away"
367,more,71,more,"This time, according to a careful plan, he took a new direction, intending to make a wide sweep that must sooner or later cut into indications of the guide's trail; and, before he had gone a quarter of a mile he came across the tracks of a large animal in the snow, and beside it the light and smaller tracks of what were beyond question human feet the feet of Défago"
335,more,61,more,"The relief he at once experienced was natural, though brief; for at first sight he saw in these tracks a simple explanation of the whole matter: these big marks had surely been left by a bull moose that, wind against it, had blundered upon the camp, and uttered its singular cry of warning and alarm the moment its mistake was apparent"
142,126-150,24,021-025,"Défago, in whom the hunting instinct was developed to the point of uncanny perfection, had scented the brute coming down the wind hours before"
63,076-010,11,011-015,"His excitement and disappearance were due, of course, to to his"
124,101-125,21,021-025,"Then the impossible explanation at which he grasped faded, as common sense showed him mercilessly that none of this was true"
114,101-125,22,021-025,"No guide, much less a guide like Défago, could have acted in so irrational a way, going off even without his rifle"
359,more,63,more,"The whole affair demanded a far more complicated elucidation, when he remembered the details of it all the cry of terror, the amazing language, the grey face of horror when his nostrils first caught the new odor; that muffled sobbing in the darkness, and for this, too, now came back to him dimly the man's original aversion for this particular bit of country"
91,076-010,18,016-020,"Besides, now that he examined them closer, these were not the tracks of a bull moose at all"
151,151-175,31,031-035,"Hank had explained to him the outline of a bull's hoofs, of a cow's or calf's, too, for that matter; he had drawn them clearly on a strip of birch bark"
31,026-050,5,003-005,"And these were wholly different"
74,076-010,14,011-015,"They were big, round, ample, and with no pointed outline as of sharp hoofs"
59,051-075,11,011-015,"He wondered for a moment whether bear tracks were like that"
144,126-150,29,026-030,"There was no other animal he could think of, for caribou did not come so far south at this season, and, even if they did, would leave hoof marks"
317,more,54,051-055,"They were ominous signs these mysterious writings left in the snow by the unknown creature that had lured a human being away from safety and when he coupled them in his imagination with that haunting sound that broke the stillness of the dawn, a momentary dizziness shook his mind, distressing him again beyond belief"
42,051-075,8,006-008,"He felt the _threatening_ aspect of it all"
191,176-200,33,031-035,"And, stooping down to examine the marks more closely, he caught a faint whiff of that sweet yet pungent odor that made him instantly straighten up again, fighting a sensation almost of nausea"
45,051-075,8,006-008,"Then his memory played him another evil trick"
217,201-225,36,036-040,"He suddenly recalled those uncovered feet projecting beyond the edge of the tent, and the body's appearance of having been dragged towards the opening; the man's shrinking from something by the door when he woke later"
69,076-010,11,011-015,"The details now beat against his trembling mind with concerted attack"
157,151-175,29,026-030,"They seemed to gather in those deep spaces of the silent forest about him, where the host of trees stood waiting, listening, watching to see what he would do"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"The woods were closing round him"
167,151-175,27,026-030,"With the persistence of true pluck, however, Simpson went forward, following the tracks as best he could, smothering these ugly emotions that sought to weaken his will"
160,151-175,31,031-035,"He blazed innumerable trees as he went, ever fearful of being unable to find the way back, and calling aloud at intervals of a few seconds the name of the guide"
165,151-175,31,031-035,"The dull tapping of the axe upon the massive trunks, and the unnatural accents of his own voice became at length sounds that he even dreaded to make, dreaded to hear"
198,176-200,35,031-035,"For they drew attention without ceasing to his presence and exact whereabouts, and if it were really the case that something was hunting himself down in the same way that he was hunting down another"
68,076-010,13,011-015,"With a strong effort, he crushed the thought out the instant it rose"
111,101-125,18,016-020,"It was the beginning, he realized, of a bewilderment utterly diabolical in kind that would speedily destroy him"
168,151-175,29,026-030,"Although the snow was not continuous, lying merely in shallow flurries over the more open spaces, he found no difficulty in following the tracks for the first few miles"
63,076-010,11,011-015,"They went straight as a ruled line wherever the trees permitted"
151,151-175,24,021-025,"The stride soon began to increase in length, till it finally assumed proportions that seemed absolutely impossible for any ordinary animal to have made"
34,026-050,6,006-008,"Like huge flying leaps they became"
200,176-200,38,036-040,"One of these he measured, and though he knew that 'stretch' of eighteen feet must be somehow wrong, he was at a complete loss to understand why he found no signs on the snow between the extreme points"
188,176-200,31,031-035,"But what perplexed him even more, making him feel his vision had gone utterly awry, was that Défago's stride increased in the same manner, and finally covered the same incredible distances"
105,101-125,19,016-020,"It looked as if the great beast had lifted him with it and carried him across these astonishing intervals"
120,101-125,23,021-025,"Simpson, who was much longer in the limb, found that he could not compass even half the stretch by taking a running jump"
177,176-200,30,026-030,"And the sight of these huge tracks, running side by side, silent evidence of a dreadful journey in which terror or madness had urged to impossible results, was profoundly moving"
47,051-075,10,009-010,"It shocked him in the secret depths of his soul"
60,051-075,12,011-015,"It was the most horrible thing his eyes had ever looked upon"
165,151-175,27,026-030,"He began to follow them mechanically, absentmindedly almost, ever peering over his shoulder to see if he, too, were being followed by something with a gigantic tread"
342,more,59,056-060,"And soon it came about that he no longer quite realized what it was they signified these impressions left upon the snow by something nameless and untamed, always accompanied by the footmarks of the little French Canadian, his guide, his comrade, the man who had shared his tent a few hours before, chatting, laughing, even singing by his side"
253,251-275,43,041-045,"For a man of his years and inexperience, only a canny Scot, perhaps, grounded in common sense and established in logic, could have preserved even that measure of balance that this youth somehow or other did manage to preserve through the whole adventure"
311,more,53,051-055,"Otherwise, two things he presently noticed, while forging pluckily ahead, must have sent him headlong back to the comparative safety of his tent, instead of only making his hands close more tightly upon the rifle stock, while his heart, trained for the Wee Kirk, sent a wordless prayer winging its way to heaven"
154,151-175,27,026-030,"Both tracks, he saw, had undergone a change, and this change, so far as it concerned the footsteps of the man, was in some undecipherable manner appalling"
106,101-125,22,021-025,"It was in the bigger tracks he first noticed this, and for a long time he could not quite believe his eyes"
170,151-175,31,031-035,"Was it the blown leaves that produced odd effects of light and shade, or that the dry snow, drifting like finely ground rice about the edges, cast shadows and high lights"
75,076-010,14,011-015,"Or was it actually the fact that the great marks had become faintly colored"
199,176-200,36,036-040,"For round about the deep, plunging holes of the animal there now appeared a mysterious, reddish tinge that was more like an effect of light than of anything that dyed the substance of the snow itself"
127,126-150,22,021-025,"Every mark had it, and had it increasingly this indistinct fiery tinge that painted a new touch of ghastliness into the picture"
271,251-275,46,046-050,"But when, wholly unable to explain or to credit it, he turned his attention to the other tracks to discover if they, too, bore similar witness, he noticed that these had meanwhile undergone a change that was infinitely worse, and charged with far more horrible suggestion"
113,101-125,22,021-025,"For, in the last hundred yards or so, he saw that they had grown gradually into the semblance of the parent tread"
57,051-075,8,006-008,"Imperceptibly the change had come about, yet unmistakably"
47,051-075,10,009-010,"It was hard to see where the change first began"
40,026-050,6,006-008,"The result, however, was beyond question"
118,101-125,19,016-020,"Smaller, neater, more cleanly modeled, they formed now an exact and careful duplicate of the larger tracks beside them"
56,051-075,9,009-010,"The feet that produced them had, therefore, also changed"
78,076-010,16,016-020,"And something in his mind reared up with loathing and with terror as he saw it"
158,151-175,27,026-030,"Simpson, for the first time, hesitated; then, ashamed of his alarm and indecision, took a few hurried steps ahead; the next instant stopped dead in his tracks"
92,076-010,18,016-020,"Immediately in front of him all signs of the trail ceased; both tracks came to an abrupt end"
109,101-125,20,016-020,"On all sides, for a hundred yards and more, he searched in vain for the least indication of their continuance"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"There was nothing"
108,101-125,19,016-020,"The trees were very thick just there, big trees all of them, spruce, cedar, hemlock; there was no underbrush"
76,076-010,13,011-015,"He stood, looking about him, all distraught; bereft of any power of judgment"
95,076-010,19,016-020,"Then he set to work to search again, and again, and yet again, but always with the same result:"
9,011-025,1,000-002,"_nothing_"
91,076-010,17,016-020,"The feet that printed the surface of the snow thus far had now, apparently, left the ground"
128,126-150,24,021-025,"And it was in that moment of distress and confusion that the whip of terror laid its most nicely calculated lash about his heart"
83,076-010,14,011-015,"It dropped with deadly effect upon the sorest spot of all, completely unnerving him"
77,076-010,16,016-020,"He had been secretly dreading all the time that it would come and come it did"
127,126-150,21,021-025,"Far overhead, muted by great height and distance, strangely thinned and wailing, he heard the crying voice of Défago, the guide"
104,101-125,19,016-020,"The sound dropped upon him out of that still, wintry sky with an effect of dismay and terror unsurpassed"
26,026-050,6,006-008,"The rifle fell to his feet"
174,151-175,28,026-030,"He stood motionless an instant, listening as it were with his whole body, then staggered back against the nearest tree for support, disorganized hopelessly in mind and spirit"
181,176-200,32,031-035,"To him, in that moment, it seemed the most shattering and dislocating experience he had ever known, so that his heart emptied itself of all feeling whatsoever as by a sudden draught"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"'Oh"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"oh"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"This fiery height"
19,011-025,5,003-005,"Oh, my feet of fire"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"My burning feet of fire"
89,076-010,15,011-015,"ran in far, beseeching accents of indescribable appeal this voice of anguish down the sky"
73,076-010,12,011-015,"Once it called then silence through all the listening wilderness of trees"
219,201-225,34,031-035,"And Simpson, scarcely knowing what he did, presently found himself running wildly to and fro, searching, calling, tripping over roots and boulders, and flinging himself in a frenzy of undirected pursuit after the Caller"
199,176-200,34,031-035,"Behind the screen of memory and emotion with which experience veils events, he plunged, distracted and half-deranged, picking up false lights like a ship at sea, terror in his eyes and heart and soul"
144,126-150,26,026-030,"For the Panic of the Wilderness had called to him in that far voice the Power of untamed Distance the Enticement of the Desolation that destroys"
147,126-150,26,026-030,"He knew in that moment all the pains of someone hopelessly and irretrievably lost, suffering the lust and travail of a soul in the final Loneliness"
162,151-175,28,026-030,"A vision of Défago, eternally hunted, driven and pursued across the skiey vastness of those ancient forests fled like a flame across the dark ruin of his thoughts"
152,151-175,27,026-030,"It seemed ages before he could find anything in the chaos of his disorganized sensations to which he could anchor himself steady for a moment, and think"
162,151-175,28,026-030,"The cry was not repeated; his own hoarse calling brought no response; the inscrutable forces of the Wild had summoned their victim beyond recall and held him fast"
206,201-225,39,036-040,"Yet he searched and called, it seems, for hours afterwards, for it was late in the afternoon when at length he decided to abandon a useless pursuit and return to his camp on the shores of Fifty Island Water"
78,076-010,14,011-015,"Even then he went with reluctance, that crying voice still echoing in his ears"
57,051-075,10,009-010,"With difficulty he found his rifle and the homeward trail"
125,101-125,21,021-025,"The concentration necessary to follow the badly blazed trees, and a biting hunger that gnawed, helped to keep his mind steady"
122,101-125,19,016-020,"Otherwise, he admits, the temporary aberration he had suffered might have been prolonged to the point of positive disaster"
106,101-125,15,011-015,"Gradually the ballast shifted back again, and he regained something that approached his normal equilibrium"
77,076-010,13,011-015,"But for all that the journey through the gathering dusk was miserably haunted"
205,201-225,32,031-035,"He heard innumerable following footsteps; voices that laughed and whispered; and saw figures crouching behind trees and boulders, making signs to one another for a concerted attack the moment he had passed"
57,051-075,11,011-015,"The creeping murmur of the wind made him start and listen"
89,076-010,16,016-020,"He went stealthily, trying to hide where possible, and making as little sound as he could"
224,201-225,36,036-040,"The shadows of the woods, hitherto protective or covering merely, had now become menacing, challenging; and the pageantry in his frightened mind masked a host of possibilities that were all the more ominous for being obscure"
97,076-010,15,011-015,"The presentiment of a nameless doom lurked ill-concealed behind every detail of what had happened"
145,126-150,26,026-030,"It was really admirable how he emerged victor in the end; men of riper powers and experience might have come through the ordeal with less success"
94,076-010,17,016-020,"He had himself tolerably well in hand, all things considered, and his plan of action proves it"
225,201-225,41,041-045,"Sleep being absolutely out of the question and traveling an unknown trail in the darkness equally impracticable, he sat up the whole of that night, rifle in hand, before a fire he never for a single moment allowed to die down"
206,201-225,39,036-040,"The severity of the haunted vigil marked his soul for life; but it was successfully accomplished; and with the very first signs of dawn he set forth upon the long return journey to the home camp to get help"
197,176-200,37,036-040,"As before, he left a written note to explain his absence, and to indicate where he had left a plentiful _cache_ of food and matches though he had no expectation that any human hands would find them"
259,251-275,51,051-055,"How Simpson found his way alone by the lake and forest might well make a story in itself, for to hear him tell it is to _know_ the passionate loneliness of soul that a man can feel when the Wilderness holds him in the hollow of its illimitable hand and laughs"
42,051-075,8,006-008,"It is also to admire his indomitable pluck"
108,101-125,16,016-020,"He claims no skill, declaring that he followed the almost invisible trail mechanically, and without thinking"
33,026-050,6,006-008,"And this, doubtless, is the truth"
69,076-010,12,011-015,"He relied upon the guiding of the unconscious mind, which is instinct"
316,more,56,056-060,"Perhaps, too, some sense of orientation, known to animals and primitive men, may have helped as well, for through all that tangled region he succeeded in reaching the exact spot where Défago had hidden the canoe nearly three days before with the remark, 'Strike doo west across the lake into the sun to find the camp"
237,226-250,47,046-050,"There was not much sun left to guide him, but he used his compass to the best of his ability, embarking in the frail craft for the last twelve miles of his journey with a sensation of immense relief that the forest was at last behind him"
146,126-150,26,026-030,"And, fortunately, the water was calm; he took his line across the center of the lake instead of coasting round the shores for another twenty miles"
45,051-075,7,006-008,"Fortunately, too, the other hunters were back"
139,126-150,25,021-025,"The light of their fires furnished a steering point without which he might have searched all night long for the actual position of the camp"
268,251-275,50,046-050,"It was close upon midnight all the same when his canoe grated on the sandy cove, and Hank, Punk and his uncle, disturbed in their sleep by his cries, ran quickly down and helped a very exhausted and broken specimen of Scotch humanity over the rocks toward a dying fire"
226,226-250,40,036-040,"The sudden entrance of his prosaic uncle into this world of wizardry and horror that had haunted him without interruption now for two days and two nights, had the immediate effect of giving to the affair an entirely new aspect"
39,026-050,8,006-008,"The sound of that crisp 'Hulloa, my boy"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"And what's up _now_"
83,076-010,14,011-015,"and the grasp of that dry and vigorous hand introduced another standard of judgment"
41,051-075,7,006-008,"A revulsion of feeling washed through him"
53,051-075,10,009-010,"He realized that he had let himself 'go' rather badly"
39,026-050,7,006-008,"He even felt vaguely ashamed of himself"
52,051-075,8,006-008,"The native hard-headedness of his race reclaimed him"
96,076-010,18,016-020,"And this doubtless explains why he found it so hard to tell that group round the fire everything"
223,201-225,40,036-040,"He told enough, however, for the immediate decision to be arrived at that a relief party must start at the earliest possible moment, and that Simpson, in order to guide it capably, must first have food and, above all, sleep"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Dr"
120,101-125,19,016-020,"Cathcart observing the lad's condition more shrewdly than his patient knew, gave him a very slight injection of morphine"
36,026-050,8,006-008,"For six hours he slept like the dead"
185,176-200,29,026-030,"From the description carefully written out afterwards by this student of divinity, it appears that the account he gave to the astonished group omitted sundry vital and important details"
143,126-150,23,021-025,"He declares that, with his uncle's wholesome, matter-of-fact countenance staring him in the face, he simply had not the courage to mention them"
370,more,66,more,"Thus, all the search party gathered, it would seem, was that Défago had suffered in the night an acute and inexplicable attack of mania, had imagined himself 'called' by someone or something, and had plunged into the bush after it without food or rifle, where he must die a horrible and lingering death by cold and starvation unless he could be found and rescued in time"
36,026-050,6,006-008,"'In time,' moreover, meant _at once_"
345,more,65,more,"In the course of the following day, however they were off by seven, leaving Punk in charge with instructions to have food and fire always ready Simpson found it possible to tell his uncle a good deal more of the story's true inwardness, without divining that it was drawn out of him as a matter of fact by a very subtle form of cross examination"
317,more,56,056-060,"By the time they reached the beginning of the trail, where the canoe was laid up against the return journey, he had mentioned how Défago spoke vaguely of 'something he called a 'Wendigo''; how he cried in his sleep; how he imagined an unusual scent about the camp; and had betrayed other symptoms of mental excitement"
124,101-125,20,016-020,"He also admitted the bewildering effect of 'that extraordinary odor' upon himself, 'pungent and acrid like the odor of lions"
224,201-225,43,041-045,"And by the time they were within an easy hour of Fifty Island Water he had let slip the further fact a foolish avowal of his own hysterical condition, as he felt afterwards that he had heard the vanished guide call 'for help"
111,101-125,18,016-020,"He omitted the singular phrases used, for he simply could not bring himself to repeat the preposterous language"
212,201-225,34,031-035,"Also, while describing how the man's footsteps in the snow had gradually assumed an exact miniature likeness of the animal's plunging tracks, he left out the fact that they measured a _wholly_ incredible distance"
115,101-125,18,016-020,"It seemed a question, nicely balanced between individual pride and honesty, what he should reveal and what suppress"
137,126-150,26,026-030,"He mentioned the fiery tinge in the snow, for instance, yet shrank from telling that body and bed had been partly dragged out of the tent"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"With the net result that Dr"
213,201-225,32,031-035,"Cathcart, adroit psychologist that he fancied himself to be, had assured him clearly enough exactly where his mind, influenced by loneliness, bewilderment and terror, had yielded to the strain and invited delusion"
114,101-125,22,021-025,"While praising his conduct, he managed at the same time to point out where, when, and how his mind had gone astray"
140,126-150,26,026-030,"He made his nephew think himself finer than he was by judicious praise, yet more foolish than he was by minimizing the value of the evidence"
184,176-200,26,026-030,"Like many another materialist, that is, he lied cleverly on the basis of insufficient knowledge, _because_ the knowledge supplied seemed to his own particular intelligence inadmissible"
148,126-150,23,021-025,"'The spell of these terrible solitudes,' he said, 'cannot leave any mind untouched, any mind, that is, possessed of the higher imaginative qualities"
77,076-010,17,016-020,"It has worked upon yours exactly as it worked upon my own when I was your age"
148,126-150,26,026-030,"The animal that haunted your little camp was undoubtedly a moose, for the 'belling' of a moose may have, sometimes, a very peculiar quality of sound"
113,101-125,20,016-020,"The colored appearance of the big tracks was obviously a defect of vision in your own eyes produced by excitement"
70,076-010,15,011-015,"The size and stretch of the tracks we shall prove when we come to them"
240,226-250,39,036-040,"But the hallucination of an audible voice, of course, is one of the commonest forms of delusion due to mental excitement an excitement, my dear boy, perfectly excusable, and, let me add, wonderfully controlled by you under the circumstances"
283,more,55,051-055,"For the rest, I am bound to say, you have acted with a splendid courage, for the terror of feeling oneself lost in this wilderness is nothing short of awful, and, had I been in your place, I don't for a moment believe I could have behaved with one quarter of your wisdom and decision"
76,076-010,14,011-015,"The only thing I find it uncommonly difficult to explain is that damned odor"
76,076-010,13,011-015,"'It made me feel sick, I assure you,' declared his nephew, 'positively dizzy"
119,101-125,17,016-020,"His uncle's attitude of calm omniscience, merely because he knew more psychological formulae, made him slightly defiant"
94,076-010,18,016-020,"It was so easy to be wise in the explanation of an experience one has not personally witnessed"
153,151-175,28,026-030,"'A kind of desolate and terrible odor is the only way I can describe it,' he concluded, glancing at the features of the quiet, unemotional man beside him"
99,076-010,19,016-020,"'I can only marvel,' was the reply, 'that under the circumstances it did not seem to you even worse"
100,076-010,16,016-020,"The dry words, Simpson knew, hovered between the truth, and his uncle's interpretation of 'the truth"
164,151-175,33,031-035,"And so at last they came to the little camp and found the tent still standing, the remains of the fire, and the piece of paper pinned to a stake beside it untouched"
123,101-125,19,016-020,"The cache, poorly contrived by inexperienced hands, however, had been discovered and opened by musk rats, mink and squirrel"
90,076-010,17,016-020,"The matches lay scattered about the opening, but the food had been taken to the last crumb"
71,076-010,11,011-015,"'Well, fellers, he ain't here,' exclaimed Hank loudly after his fashion"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"'And that's as sartain as the coal supply down below"
95,076-010,20,016-020,"But whar he's got to by this time is 'bout as unsartain as the trade in crowns in t'other place"
136,126-150,26,026-030,"The presence of a divinity student was no barrier to his language at such a time, though for the reader's sake it may be severely edited"
74,076-010,15,011-015,"'I propose,' he added, 'that we start out at once an' hunt for'm like hell"
153,151-175,26,026-030,"The gloom of Défago's probable fate oppressed the whole party with a sense of dreadful gravity the moment they saw the familiar signs of recent occupancy"
152,151-175,27,026-030,"Especially the tent, with the bed of balsam branches still smoothed and flattened by the pressure of his body, seemed to bring his presence near to them"
114,101-125,19,016-020,"Simpson, feeling vaguely as if his world were somehow at stake, went about explaining particulars in a hushed tone"
79,076-010,14,011-015,"He was much calmer now, though overwearied with the strain of his many journeys"
146,126-150,24,021-025,"His uncle's method of explaining 'explaining away,' rather the details still fresh in his haunted memory helped, too, to put ice upon his emotions"
157,151-175,29,026-030,"'And that's the direction he ran off in,' he said to his two companions, pointing in the direction where the guide had vanished that morning in the grey dawn"
77,076-010,15,011-015,"'Straight down there he ran like a deer, in between the birch and the hemlock"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"Hank and Dr"
26,026-050,3,003-005,"Cathcart exchanged glances"
202,201-225,37,036-040,"'And it was about two miles down there, in a straight line,' continued the other, speaking with something of the former terror in his voice, 'that I followed his trail to the place where it stopped dead"
165,151-175,28,026-030,"'And where you heered him callin' an' caught the stench, an' all the rest of the wicked entertainment,' cried Hank, with a volubility that betrayed his keen distress"
86,076-010,14,011-015,"'And where your excitement overcame you to the point of producing illusions,' added Dr"
73,076-010,15,011-015,"Cathcart under his breath, yet not so low that his nephew did not hear it"
116,101-125,22,021-025,"It was early in the afternoon, for they had traveled quickly, and there were still a good two hours of daylight left"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Dr"
103,101-125,18,016-020,"Cathcart and Hank lost no time in beginning the search, but Simpson was too exhausted to accompany them"
82,076-010,14,011-015,"They would follow the blazed marks on the trees, and where possible, his footsteps"
76,076-010,16,016-020,"Meanwhile the best thing he could do was to keep a good fire going, and rest"
124,101-125,21,021-025,"But after something like three hours' search, the darkness already down, the two men returned to camp with nothing to report"
220,201-225,40,036-040,"Fresh snow had covered all signs, and though they had followed the blazed trees to the spot where Simpson had turned back, they had not discovered the smallest indication of a human being or for that matter, of an animal"
64,076-010,12,011-015,"There were no fresh tracks of any kind; the snow lay undisturbed"
102,101-125,20,016-020,"It was difficult to know what was best to do, though in reality there was nothing more they _could_ do"
67,076-010,12,011-015,"They might stay and search for weeks without much chance of success"
116,101-125,20,016-020,"The fresh snow destroyed their only hope, and they gathered round the fire for supper, a gloomy and despondent party"
130,126-150,24,021-025,"The facts, indeed, were sad enough, for Défago had a wife at Rat Portage, and his earnings were the family's sole means of support"
111,101-125,21,021-025,"Now that the whole truth in all its ugliness was out, it seemed useless to deal in further disguise or pretense"
49,051-075,8,006-008,"They talked openly of the facts and probabilities"
55,051-075,12,011-015,"It was not the first time, even in the experience of Dr"
303,more,56,056-060,"Cathcart, that a man had yielded to the singular seduction of the Solitudes and gone out of his mind; Défago, moreover, was predisposed to something of the sort, for he already had a touch of melancholia in his blood, and his fiber was weakened by bouts of drinking that often lasted for weeks at a time"
111,101-125,21,021-025,"Something on this trip one might never know precisely what had sufficed to push him over the line, that was all"
106,101-125,20,016-020,"And he had gone, gone off into the great wilderness of trees and lakes to die by starvation and exhaustion"
214,201-225,37,036-040,"The chances against his finding camp again were overwhelming; the delirium that was upon him would also doubtless have increased, and it was quite likely he might do violence to himself and so hasten his cruel fate"
57,051-075,10,009-010,"Even while they talked, indeed, the end had probably come"
200,176-200,36,036-040,"On the suggestion of Hank, his old pal, however, they proposed to wait a little longer and devote the whole of the following day, from dawn to darkness, to the most systematic search they could devise"
44,051-075,7,006-008,"They would divide the territory between them"
41,051-075,7,006-008,"They discussed their plan in great detail"
35,026-050,8,006-008,"All that men could do they would do"
158,151-175,27,026-030,"And, meanwhile, they talked about the particular form in which the singular Panic of the Wilderness had made its attack upon the mind of the unfortunate guide"
123,101-125,20,016-020,"Hank, though familiar with the legend in its general outline, obviously did not welcome the turn the conversation had taken"
58,051-075,8,006-008,"He contributed little, though that little was illuminating"
265,251-275,49,046-050,"For he admitted that a story ran over all this section of country to the effect that several Indians had 'seen the Wendigo' along the shores of Fifty Island Water in the 'fall' of last year, and that this was the true reason of Défago's disinclination to hunt there"
92,076-010,18,016-020,"Hank doubtless felt that he had in a sense helped his old pal to death by overpersuading him"
142,126-150,25,021-025,"'When an Indian goes crazy,' he explained, talking to himself more than to the others, it seemed, 'it's always put that he's 'seen the Wendigo"
62,076-010,12,011-015,"' An' pore old Défaygo was superstitious down to he very heels"
199,176-200,33,031-035,"And then Simpson, feeling the atmosphere more sympathetic, told over again the full story of his astonishing tale; he left out no details this time; he mentioned his own sensations and gripping fears"
41,051-075,7,006-008,"He only omitted the strange language used"
117,101-125,20,016-020,"'But Défago surely had already told you all these details of the Wendigo legend, my dear fellow,' insisted the doctor"
117,101-125,21,021-025,"'I mean, he had talked about it, and thus put into your mind the ideas which your own excitement afterwards developed"
42,051-075,6,006-008,"Whereupon Simpson again repeated the facts"
51,051-075,8,006-008,"Défago, he declared, had barely mentioned the beast"
98,076-010,19,016-020,"He, Simpson, knew nothing of the story, and, so far as he remembered, had never even read about it"
28,026-050,5,003-005,"Even the word was unfamiliar"
42,051-075,9,009-010,"Of course he was telling the truth, and Dr"
86,076-010,13,011-015,"Cathcart was reluctantly compelled to admit the singular character of the whole affair"
57,051-075,13,011-015,"He did not do this in words so much as in manner, however"
364,more,70,more,"He kept his back against a good, stout tree; he poked the fire into a blaze the moment it showed signs of dying down; he was quicker than any of them to notice the least sound in the night about them a fish jumping in the lake, a twig snapping in the bush, the dropping of occasional fragments of frozen snow from the branches overhead where the heat loosened them"
96,076-010,17,016-020,"His voice, too, changed a little in quality, becoming a shade less confident, lower also in tone"
208,201-225,39,036-040,"Fear, to put it plainly, hovered close about that little camp, and though all three would have been glad to speak of other matters, the only thing they seemed able to discuss was this the source of their fear"
70,076-010,13,011-015,"They tried other subjects in vain; there was nothing to say about them"
62,076-010,13,011-015,"Hank was the most honest of the group; he said next to nothing"
55,051-075,10,009-010,"He never once, however, turned his back to the darkness"
109,101-125,22,021-025,"His face was always to the forest, and when wood was needed he didn't go farther than was necessary to get it"
149,126-150,27,026-030,"A wall of silence wrapped them in, for the snow, though not thick, was sufficient to deaden any noise, and the frost held things pretty tight besides"
75,076-010,15,011-015,"No sound but their voices and the soft roar of the flames made itself heard"
108,101-125,21,021-025,"Only, from time to time, something soft as the flutter of a pine moth's wings went past them through the air"
34,026-050,8,006-008,"No one seemed anxious to go to bed"
34,026-050,5,003-005,"The hours slipped towards midnight"
262,251-275,45,041-045,"'The legend is picturesque enough,' observed the doctor after one of the longer pauses, speaking to break it rather than because he had anything to say, 'for the Wendigo is simply the Call of the Wild personified, which some natures hear to their own destruction"
38,026-050,6,006-008,"'That's about it,' Hank said presently"
32,026-050,4,003-005,"'An' there's no misunderstandin'"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"when you hear it"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"It calls you by name right 'nough"
22,026-050,3,003-005,"Another pause followed"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"Then Dr"
81,076-010,15,011-015,"Cathcart came back to the forbidden subject with a rush that made the others jump"
207,201-225,35,031-035,"'The allegory _is_ significant,' he remarked, looking about him into the darkness, 'for the Voice, they say, resembles all the minor sounds of the Bush wind, falling water, cries of the animals, and so forth"
62,076-010,12,011-015,"And, once the victim hears _that_ he's off for good, of course"
157,151-175,31,031-035,"His most vulnerable points, moreover, are said to be the feet and the eyes; the feet, you see, for the lust of wandering, and the eyes for the lust of beauty"
96,076-010,19,016-020,"The poor beggar goes at such a dreadful speed that he bleeds beneath the eyes, and his feet burn"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Dr"
76,076-010,12,011-015,"Cathcart, as he spoke, continued to peer uneasily into the surrounding gloom"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"His voice sank to a hushed tone"
177,176-200,32,031-035,"'The Wendigo,' he added, 'is said to burn his feet owing to the friction, apparently caused by its tremendous velocity till they drop off, and new ones form exactly like its own"
102,101-125,17,016-020,"Simpson listened in horrified amazement; but it was the pallor on Hank's face that fascinated him most"
74,076-010,14,011-015,"He would willingly have stopped his ears and closed his eyes, had he dared"
149,126-150,29,026-030,"'It don't always keep to the ground neither,' came in Hank's slow, heavy drawl, 'for it goes so high that he thinks the stars have set him all a-fire"
199,176-200,37,036-040,"An' it'll take great thumpin' jumps sometimes, an' run along the tops of the trees, carrying its partner with it, an' then droppin' him jest as a fish hawk'll drop a pickerel to kill it before eatin'"
55,051-075,13,011-015,"An' its food, of all the muck in the whole Bush is moss"
39,026-050,7,006-008,"And he laughed a short, unnatural laugh"
100,076-010,17,016-020,"'It's a moss-eater, is the Wendigo,' he added, looking up excitedly into the faces of his companions"
85,076-010,14,011-015,"'Moss-eater,' he repeated, with a string of the most outlandish oaths he could invent"
60,051-075,11,011-015,"But Simpson now understood the true purpose of all this talk"
109,101-125,19,016-020,"What these two men, each strong and 'experienced' in his own way, dreaded more than anything else was silence"
30,026-050,5,003-005,"They were talking against time"
238,226-250,37,036-040,"They were also talking against darkness, against the invasion of panic, against the admission reflection might bring that they were in an enemy's country against anything, in fact, rather than allow their inmost thoughts to assume control"
101,101-125,18,016-020,"He himself, already initiated by the awful vigil with terror, was beyond both of them in this respect"
44,051-075,9,009-010,"He had reached the stage where he was immune"
130,126-150,21,021-025,"But these two, the scoffing, analytical doctor, and the honest, dogged backwoodsman, each sat trembling in the depths of his being"
220,201-225,39,036-040,"Thus the hours passed; and thus, with lowered voices and a kind of taut inner resistance of spirit, this little group of humanity sat in the jaws of the wilderness and talked foolishly of the terrible and haunting legend"
127,126-150,22,021-025,"It was an unequal contest, all things considered, for the wilderness had already the advantage of first attack and of a hostage"
122,101-125,19,016-020,"The fate of their comrade hung over them with a steadily increasing weight of oppression that finally became insupportable"
269,251-275,47,046-050,"It was Hank, after a pause longer than the preceding ones that no one seemed able to break, who first let loose all this pent-up emotion in very unexpected fashion, by springing suddenly to his feet and letting out the most ear-shattering yell imaginable into the night"
50,051-075,9,009-010,"He could not contain himself any longer, it seemed"
119,101-125,23,021-025,"To make it carry even beyond an ordinary cry he interrupted its rhythm by shaking the palm of his hand before his mouth"
204,201-225,38,036-040,"'That's for Défago,' he said, looking down at the other two with a queer, defiant laugh, 'for it's my belief' the sandwiched oaths may be omitted 'that my ole partner's not far from us at this very minute"
194,176-200,33,031-035,"There was a vehemence and recklessness about his performance that made Simpson, too, start to his feet in amazement, and betrayed even the doctor into letting the pipe slip from between his lips"
109,101-125,19,016-020,"Hank's face was ghastly, but Cathcart's showed a sudden weakness a loosening of all his faculties, as it were"
158,151-175,27,026-030,"Then a momentary anger blazed into his eyes, and he too, though with deliberation born of habitual self-control, got upon his feet and faced the excited guide"
82,076-010,15,011-015,"For this was unpermissible, foolish, dangerous, and he meant to stop it in the bud"
482,more,84,more,"What might have happened in the next minute or two one may speculate about, yet never definitely know, for in the instant of profound silence that followed Hank's roaring voice, and as though in answer to it, something went past through the darkness of the sky overhead at terrific speed something of necessity very large, for it displaced much air, while down between the trees there fell a faint and windy cry of a human voice, calling in tones of indescribable anguish and appeal"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"'Oh, oh"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"This fiery height"
6,000-010,2,000-002,"Oh, oh"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"My feet of fire"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"My burning feet of fire"
80,076-010,16,016-020,"White to the very edge of his shirt, Hank looked stupidly about him like a child"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Dr"
192,176-200,33,031-035,"Cathcart uttered some kind of unintelligible cry, turning as he did so with an instinctive movement of blind terror towards the protection of the tent, then halting in the act as though frozen"
67,076-010,12,011-015,"Simpson, alone of the three, retained his presence of mind a little"
62,076-010,12,011-015,"His own horror was too deep to allow of any immediate reaction"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"He had heard that cry before"
57,051-075,9,009-010,"Turning to his stricken companions, he said almost calmly"
54,051-075,11,011-015,"'That's exactly the cry I heard the very words he used"
66,076-010,12,011-015,"Then, lifting his face to the sky, he cried aloud, 'Défago, Défago"
20,011-025,5,003-005,"Come down here to us"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"Come down"
251,251-275,44,041-045,"And before there was time for anybody to take definite action one way or another, there came the sound of something dropping heavily between the trees, striking the branches on the way down, and landing with a dreadful thud upon the frozen earth below"
47,051-075,9,009-010,"The crash and thunder of it was really terrific"
36,026-050,7,006-008,"'That's him, s'help me the good Gawd"
113,101-125,20,016-020,"came from Hank in a whispering cry half choked, his hand going automatically toward the hunting knife in his belt"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"'And he's coming"
11,011-025,2,000-002,"He's coming"
191,176-200,30,026-030,"he added, with an irrational laugh of horror, as the sounds of heavy footsteps crunching over the snow became distinctly audible, approaching through the blackness towards the circle of light"
141,126-150,24,021-025,"And while the steps, with their stumbling motion, moved nearer and nearer upon them, the three men stood round that fire, motionless and dumb"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Dr"
82,076-010,15,011-015,"Cathcart had the appearance of a man suddenly withered; even his eyes did not move"
88,076-010,14,011-015,"Hank, suffering shockingly, seemed on the verge again of violent action; yet did nothing"
26,026-050,6,006-008,"He, too, was hewn of stone"
34,026-050,5,003-005,"Like stricken children they seemed"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"The picture was hideous"
97,076-010,14,011-015,"And, meanwhile, their owner still invisible, the footsteps came closer, crunching the frozen snow"
81,076-010,14,011-015,"It was endless too prolonged to be quite real this measured and pitiless approach"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"It was accursed"
86,076-010,13,011-015,"Then at length the darkness, having thus laboriously conceived, brought forth a figure"
136,126-150,24,021-025,"It drew forward into the zone of uncertain light where fire and shadows mingled, not ten feet away; then halted, staring at them fixedly"
239,226-250,46,046-050,"The same instant it started forward again with the spasmodic motion as of a thing moved by wires, and coming up closer to them, full into the glare of the fire, they perceived then that it was a man; and apparently that this man was Défago"
207,201-225,37,036-040,"Something like a skin of horror almost perceptibly drew down in that moment over every face, and three pairs of eyes shone through it as though they saw across the frontiers of normal vision into the Unknown"
167,151-175,30,026-030,"Défago advanced, his tread faltering and uncertain; he made his way straight up to them as a group first, then turned sharply and peered close into the face of Simpson"
41,051-075,9,009-010,"The sound of a voice issued from his lips"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"'Here I am, Boss Simpson"
27,026-050,5,003-005,"I heered someone calling me"
81,076-010,15,011-015,"It was a faint, dried up voice, made wheezy and breathless as by immense exertion"
51,051-075,11,011-015,"'I'm havin' a reg'lar hellfire kind of a trip, I am"
64,076-010,11,011-015,"And he laughed, thrusting his head forward into the other's face"
93,076-010,16,016-020,"But that laugh started the machinery of the group of waxwork figures with the wax-white skins"
181,176-200,32,031-035,"Hank immediately sprang forward with a stream of oaths so farfetched that Simpson did not recognize them as English at all, but thought he had lapsed into Indian or some other lingo"
95,076-010,14,011-015,"He only realized that Hank's presence, thrust thus between them, was welcome uncommonly welcome"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Dr"
82,076-010,11,011-015,"Cathcart, though more calmly and leisurely, advanced behind him, heavily stumbling"
217,201-225,39,036-040,"Simpson seems hazy as to what was actually said and done in those next few seconds, for the eyes of that detestable and blasted visage peering at such close quarters into his own utterly bewildered his senses at first"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"He merely stood still"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"He said nothing"
109,101-125,21,021-025,"He had not the trained will of the older men that forced them into action in defiance of all emotional stress"
103,101-125,17,016-020,"He watched them moving as behind a glass that half destroyed their reality; it was dreamlike; perverted"
197,176-200,31,031-035,"Yet, through the torrent of Hank's meaningless phrases, he remembers hearing his uncle's tone of authority hard and forced saying several things about food and warmth, blankets, whisky and the rest"
142,126-150,20,016-020,"and, further, that whiffs of that penetrating, unaccustomed odor, vile yet sweetly bewildering, assailed his nostrils during all that followed"
266,251-275,46,046-050,"It was no less a person than himself, however less experienced and adroit than the others though he was who gave instinctive utterance to the sentence that brought a measure of relief into the ghastly situation by expressing the doubt and thought in each one's heart"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"'It _is_ YOU, isn't it, Défago"
53,051-075,9,009-010,"he asked under his breath, horror breaking his speech"
94,076-010,19,016-020,"And at once Cathcart burst out with the loud answer before the other had time to move his lips"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"'Of course it is"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"Of course it is"
68,076-010,12,011-015,"Only can't you see he's nearly dead with exhaustion, cold and terror"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"Isn't _that_"
45,051-075,8,006-008,"enough to change a man beyond all recognition"
74,076-010,15,011-015,"It was said in order to convince himself as much as to convince the others"
34,026-050,5,003-005,"The overemphasis alone proved that"
77,076-010,14,011-015,"And continually, while he spoke and acted, he held a handkerchief to his nose"
33,026-050,6,006-008,"That odor pervaded the whole camp"
291,more,55,051-055,"For the 'Défago' who sat huddled by the big fire, wrapped in blankets, drinking hot whisky and holding food in wasted hands, was no more like the guide they had last seen alive than the picture of a man of sixty is like a daguerreotype of his early youth in the costume of another generation"
111,101-125,16,016-020,"Nothing really can describe that ghastly caricature, that parody, masquerading there in the firelight as Défago"
271,251-275,45,041-045,"From the ruins of the dark and awful memories he still retains, Simpson declares that the face was more animal than human, the features drawn about into wrong proportions, the skin loose and hanging, as though he had been subjected to extraordinary pressures and tensions"
200,176-200,37,036-040,"It made him think vaguely of those bladder faces blown up by the hawkers on Ludgate Hill, that change their expression as they swell, and as they collapse emit a faint and wailing imitation of a voice"
62,076-010,9,009-010,"Both face and voice suggested some such abominable resemblance"
270,251-275,43,041-045,"But Cathcart long afterwards, seeking to describe the indescribable, asserts that thus might have looked a face and body that had been in air so rarified that, the weight of atmosphere being removed, the entire structure threatened to fly asunder and become _incoherent_"
165,151-175,29,026-030,"It was Hank, though all distraught and shaking with a tearing volume of emotion he could neither handle nor understand, who brought things to a head without much ado"
233,226-250,43,041-045,"He went off to a little distance from the fire, apparently so that the light should not dazzle him too much, and shading his eyes for a moment with both hands, shouted in a loud voice that held anger and affection dreadfully mingled:"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"'You ain't Défaygo"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"You ain't Défaygo at all"
67,076-010,15,011-015,"I don't give a damn, but that ain't you, my ole pal of twenty years"
78,076-010,15,011-015,"He glared upon the huddled figure as though he would destroy him with his eyes"
107,101-125,24,021-025,"'An' if it is I'll swab the floor of hell with a wad of cotton wool on a toothpick, s'help me the good Gawd"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"he added, with a violent fling of horror and disgust"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"It was impossible to silence him"
104,101-125,18,016-020,"He stood there shouting like one possessed, horrible to see, horrible to hear _because it was the truth_"
79,076-010,13,011-015,"He repeated himself in fifty different ways, each more outlandish than the last"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"The woods rang with echoes"
149,126-150,28,026-030,"At one time it looked as if he meant to fling himself upon 'the intruder,' for his hand continually jerked towards the long hunting knife in his belt"
93,076-010,17,016-020,"But in the end he did nothing, and the whole tempest completed itself very shortly with tears"
142,126-150,26,026-030,"Hank's voice suddenly broke, he collapsed on the ground, and Cathcart somehow or other persuaded him at last to go into the tent and lie quiet"
158,151-175,28,026-030,"The remainder of the affair, indeed, was witnessed by him from behind the canvas, his white and terrified face peeping through the crack of the tent door flap"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"Then Dr"
192,176-200,36,036-040,"Cathcart, closely followed by his nephew who so far had kept his courage better than all of them, went up with a determined air and stood opposite to the figure of Défago huddled over the fire"
44,051-075,9,009-010,"He looked him squarely in the face and spoke"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"At first his voice was firm"
88,076-010,18,016-020,"'Défago, tell us what's happened just a little, so that we can know how best to help you"
50,051-075,10,009-010,"he asked in a tone of authority, almost of command"
35,026-050,7,006-008,"And at that point, it _was_ command"
218,201-225,38,036-040,"At once afterwards, however, it changed in quality, for the figure turned up to him a face so piteous, so terrible and so little like humanity, that the doctor shrank back from him as from something spiritually unclean"
211,201-225,35,031-035,"Simpson, watching close behind him, says he got the impression of a mask that was on the verge of dropping off, and that underneath they would discover something black and diabolical, revealed in utter nakedness"
30,026-050,7,006-008,"'Out with it, man, out with it"
58,051-075,9,009-010,"Cathcart cried, terror running neck and neck with entreaty"
38,026-050,8,006-008,"'None of us can stand this much longer"
38,026-050,8,006-008,"It was the cry of instinct over reason"
149,126-150,24,021-025,"And then 'Défago,' smiling _whitely_, answered in that thin and fading voice that already seemed passing over into a sound of quite another character"
98,076-010,17,016-020,"'I seen that great Wendigo thing,' he whispered, sniffing the air about him exactly like an animal"
21,011-025,6,006-008,"'I been with it too '"
58,051-075,11,011-015,"Whether the poor devil would have said more, or whether Dr"
223,201-225,39,036-040,"Cathcart would have continued the impossible cross examination cannot be known, for at that moment the voice of Hank was heard yelling at the top of his voice from behind the canvas that concealed all but his terrified eyes"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"Such a howling was never heard"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"'His feet"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"Oh, Gawd, his feet"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"Look at his great changed feet"
133,126-150,27,026-030,"Défago, shuffling where he sat, had moved in such a way that for the first time his legs were in full light and his feet were visible"
68,076-010,13,011-015,"Yet Simpson had no time, himself, to see properly what Hank had seen"
35,026-050,8,006-008,"And Hank has never seen fit to tell"
333,more,59,056-060,"That same instant, with a leap like that of a frightened tiger, Cathcart was upon him, bundling the folds of blanket about his legs with such speed that the young student caught little more than a passing glimpse of something dark and oddly massed where moccasined feet ought to have been, and saw even that but with uncertain vision"
309,more,56,056-060,"Then, before the doctor had time to do more, or Simpson time to even think a question, much less ask it, Défago was standing upright in front of them, balancing with pain and difficulty, and upon his shapeless and twisted visage an expression so dark and so malicious that it was, in the true sense, monstrous"
69,076-010,13,011-015,"'Now _you_ seen it too,' he wheezed, 'you seen my fiery, burning feet"
73,076-010,16,016-020,"And now that is, unless you kin save me an' prevent it's 'bout time for '"
113,101-125,21,021-025,"His piteous and beseeching voice was interrupted by a sound that was like the roar of wind coming across the lake"
47,051-075,7,006-008,"The trees overhead shook their tangled branches"
50,051-075,10,009-010,"The blazing fire bent its flames as before a blast"
134,126-150,24,021-025,"And something swept with a terrific, rushing noise about the little camp and seemed to surround it entirely in a single moment of time"
270,251-275,46,046-050,"Défago shook the clinging blankets from his body, turned towards the woods behind, and with the same stumbling motion that had brought him was gone: gone, before anyone could move muscle to prevent him, gone with an amazing, blundering swiftness that left no time to act"
292,more,53,051-055,"The darkness positively swallowed him; and less than a dozen seconds later, above the roar of the swaying trees and the shout of the sudden wind, all three men, watching and listening with stricken hearts, heard a cry that seemed to drop down upon them from a great height of sky and distance"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"'Oh, oh"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"This fiery height"
6,000-010,2,000-002,"Oh, oh"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"My feet of fire"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"My burning feet of fire"
45,051-075,8,006-008,"then died away, into untold space and silence"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Dr"
156,151-175,29,026-030,"Cathcart suddenly master of himself, and therefore of the others was just able to seize Hank violently by the arm as he tried to dash headlong into the Bush"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"'But I want ter know, you"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"shrieked the guide"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"'I want ter see"
67,076-010,13,011-015,"That ain't him at all, but some devil that's shunted into his place"
119,101-125,24,021-025,"Somehow or other he admits he never quite knew how he accomplished it he managed to keep him in the tent and pacify him"
115,101-125,20,016-020,"The doctor, apparently, had reached the stage where reaction had set in and allowed his own innate force to conquer"
37,026-050,5,003-005,"Certainly he 'managed' Hank admirably"
316,more,53,051-055,"It was his nephew, however, hitherto so wonderfully controlled, who gave him most cause for anxiety, for the cumulative strain had now produced a condition of lachrymose hysteria which made it necessary to isolate him upon a bed of boughs and blankets as far removed from Hank as was possible under the circumstances"
168,151-175,29,026-030,"And there he lay, as the watches of that haunted night passed over the lonely camp, crying startled sentences, and fragments of sentences, into the folds of his blanket"
109,101-125,18,016-020,"A quantity of gibberish about speed and height and fire mingled oddly with biblical memories of the classroom"
94,076-010,18,016-020,"'People with broken faces all on fire are coming at a most awful, awful, pace towards the camp"
258,251-275,48,046-050,"he would moan one minute; and the next would sit up and stare into the woods, intently listening, and whisper, 'How terrible in the wilderness are are the feet of them that ' until his uncle came across to change the direction of his thoughts and comfort him"
47,051-075,6,006-008,"The hysteria, fortunately, proved but temporary"
38,026-050,8,006-008,"Sleep cured him, just as it cured Hank"
66,076-010,12,011-015,"Till the first signs of daylight came, soon after five o'clock, Dr"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"Cathcart kept his vigil"
80,076-010,15,011-015,"His face was the color of chalk, and there were strange flushes beneath the eyes"
84,076-010,15,011-015,"An appalling terror of the soul battled with his will all through those silent hours"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"These were some of the outer signs"
280,more,53,051-055,"At dawn he lit the fire himself, made breakfast, and woke the others, and by seven they were well on their way back to the home camp three perplexed and afflicted men, but each in his own way having reduced his inner turmoil to a condition of more or less systematized order again"
191,176-200,32,031-035,"They talked little, and then only of the most wholesome and common things, for their minds were charged with painful thoughts that clamoured for explanation, though no one dared refer to them"
104,101-125,18,016-020,"Hank, being nearest to primitive conditions, was the first to find himself, for he was also less complex"
5,000-010,2,000-002,"In Dr"
79,076-010,10,009-010,"Cathcart 'civilization' championed his forces against an attack singular enough"
62,076-010,12,011-015,"To this day, perhaps, he is not _quite_ sure of certain things"
39,026-050,7,006-008,"Anyhow, he took longer to 'find himself"
141,126-150,22,021-025,"Simpson, the student of divinity, it was who arranged his conclusions probably with the best, though not most scientific, appearance of order"
120,101-125,17,016-020,"Out there, in the heart of unreclaimed wilderness, they had surely witnessed something crudely and essentially primitive"
140,126-150,21,021-025,"Something that had survived somehow the advance of humanity had emerged terrifically, betraying a scale of life still monstrous and immature"
252,251-275,41,041-045,"He envisaged it rather as a glimpse into prehistoric ages, when superstitions, gigantic and uncouth, still oppressed the hearts of men; when the forces of nature were still untamed, the Powers that may have haunted a primeval universe not yet withdrawn"
212,201-225,37,036-040,"To this day he thinks of what he termed years later in a sermon 'savage and formidable Potencies lurking behind the souls of men, not evil perhaps in themselves, yet instinctively hostile to humanity as it exists"
119,101-125,22,021-025,"With his uncle he never discussed the matter in detail, for the barrier between the two types of mind made it difficult"
115,101-125,21,021-025,"Only once, years later, something led them to the frontier of the subject of a single detail of the subject, rather"
45,051-075,9,009-010,"'Can't you even tell me what _they_ were like"
134,126-150,26,026-030,"he asked; and the reply, though conceived in wisdom, was not encouraging, 'It is far better you should not try to know, or to find out"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"'Well that odour"
20,011-025,3,003-005,"persisted the nephew"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"'What do you make of that"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Dr"
46,051-075,8,006-008,"Cathcart looked at him and raised his eyebrows"
87,076-010,14,011-015,"'Odours,' he replied, 'are not so easy as sounds and sights of telepathic communication"
58,051-075,12,011-015,"I make as much, or as little, probably, as you do yourself"
55,051-075,11,011-015,"He was not quite so glib as usual with his explanations"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"That was all"
162,151-175,30,026-030,"At the fall of day, cold, exhausted, famished, the party came to the end of the long portage and dragged themselves into a camp that at first glimpse seemed empty"
61,051-075,12,011-015,"Fire there was none, and no Punk came forward to welcome them"
299,more,53,051-055,"The emotional capacity of all three was too over-spent to recognize either surprise or annoyance; but the cry of spontaneous affection that burst from the lips of Hank, as he rushed ahead of them towards the fire-place, came probably as a warning that the end of the amazing affair was not quite yet"
291,more,47,046-050,"And both Cathcart and his nephew confessed afterwards that when they saw him kneel down in his excitement and embrace something that reclined, gently moving, beside the extinguished ashes, they felt in their very bones that this 'something' would prove to be Défago the true Défago, returned"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"And so, indeed, it was"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"It is soon told"
134,126-150,25,021-025,"Exhausted to the point of emaciation, the French Canadian what was left of him, that is fumbled among the ashes, trying to make a fire"
115,101-125,19,016-020,"His body crouched there, the weak fingers obeying feebly the instinctive habit of a lifetime with twigs and matches"
63,076-010,12,011-015,"But there was no longer any mind to direct the simple operation"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"The mind had fled beyond recall"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"And with it, too, had fled memory"
57,051-075,11,011-015,"Not only recent events, but all previous life was a blank"
70,076-010,12,011-015,"This time it was the real man, though incredibly and horribly shrunken"
80,076-010,14,011-015,"On his face was no expression of any kind whatever fear, welcome, or recognition"
133,126-150,29,026-030,"He did not seem to know who it was that embraced him, or who it was that fed, warmed and spoke to him the words of comfort and relief"
92,076-010,18,016-020,"Forlorn and broken beyond all reach of human aid, the little man did meekly as he was bidden"
75,076-010,11,011-015,"The 'something' that had constituted him 'individual' had vanished for ever"
403,more,75,more,"In some ways it was more terribly moving than anything they had yet seen that idiot smile as he drew wads of coarse moss from his swollen cheeks and told them that he was 'a damned moss-eater'; the continued vomiting of even the simplest food; and, worst of all, the piteous and childish voice of complaint in which he told them that his feet pained him 'burn like fire' which was natural enough when Dr"
65,076-010,10,009-010,"Cathcart examined them and found that both were dreadfully frozen"
64,076-010,10,009-010,"Beneath the eyes there were faint indications of recent bleeding"
239,226-250,46,046-050,"The details of how he survived the prolonged exposure, of where he had been, or of how he covered the great distance from one camp to the other, including an immense detour of the lake on foot since he had no canoe all this remains unknown"
34,026-050,5,003-005,"His memory had vanished completely"
141,126-150,24,021-025,"And before the end of the winter whose beginning witnessed this strange occurrence, Défago, bereft of mind, memory and soul, had gone with it"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"He lingered only a few weeks"
81,076-010,16,016-020,"And what Punk was able to contribute to the story throws no further light upon it"
193,176-200,37,036-040,"He was cleaning fish by the lake shore about five o'clock in the evening an hour, that is, before the search party returned when he saw this shadow of the guide picking its way weakly into camp"
80,076-010,15,011-015,"In advance of him, he declares, came the faint whiff of a certain singular odour"
43,051-075,8,006-008,"That same instant old Punk started for home"
86,076-010,16,016-020,"He covered the entire journey of three days as only Indian blood could have covered it"
36,026-050,8,006-008,"The terror of a whole race drove him"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"He knew what it all meant"
28,026-050,5,003-005,"Défago had 'seen the Wendigo"
51,051-075,10,009-010,"Lone Flower, hemmed in with snows and white as they"
42,051-075,9,009-010,"But hardier far, once more I see thee bend"
38,026-050,7,006-008,"Thy forehead, as if fearful to offend,"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"Like an unbidden guest"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"Though day by day,"
48,051-075,6,006-008,"Storms, sallying from the mountain-tops, way-lay"
42,051-075,8,006-008,"The rising sun, and on the plains descend;"
46,051-075,8,006-008,"Yet art thou welcome, welcome as a friend[377]"
30,026-050,5,003-005,"Whose zeal outruns his promise"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"Blue-eyed May"
41,051-075,7,006-008,"Shall soon behold this border thickly set"
44,051-075,6,006-008,"With bright jonquils, their odours lavishing"
43,051-075,8,006-008,"On the soft west-wind and his frolic peers;"
40,026-050,8,006-008,"Nor will I then thy modest grace forget,"
48,051-075,6,006-008,"Chaste Snow-drop, venturous harbinger of Spring,"
37,026-050,6,006-008,"And pensive monitor of fleeting years"
40,026-050,5,003-005,"When haughty expectations prostrate lie,"
42,051-075,7,006-008,"And grandeur crouches like a guilty thing,"
43,051-075,8,006-008,"Oft shall the lowly weak, till nature bring"
31,026-050,5,003-005,"Mature release, in fair society"
40,026-050,6,006-008,"Survive, and Fortune's utmost anger try;"
48,051-075,7,006-008,"Like these frail snow-drops that together cling,"
42,051-075,8,006-008,"And nod their helmets, smitten by the wing"
41,051-075,7,006-008,"Of many a furious whirl-blast sweeping by"
28,026-050,4,003-005,"Observe the faithful flowers"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"if small to great"
52,051-075,9,009-010,"May lead the thoughts, thus struggling used to stand"
40,026-050,5,003-005,"The Emathian phalanx, nobly obstinate;11"
39,026-050,7,006-008,"And so the bright immortal Theban band,"
45,051-075,7,006-008,"Whom onset, fiercely urged at Jove's command,"
39,026-050,6,006-008,"Might overwhelm, but could not separate"
48,051-075,8,006-008,"Among the mountains were we nursed, loved Stream"
45,051-075,7,006-008,"Thou near the eagle's nestvwithin brief sail,"
41,051-075,9,009-010,"I, of his bold wing floating on the gale,"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"Where thy deep voice could lull me"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"Faint the beam"
41,051-075,8,006-008,"Of human life when first allowed to gleam"

18,011-025,4,003-005,"Of thy soft breath"
28,026-050,4,003-005,"--Less vivid wreath entwined"

91,076-010,17,016-020,"On July 16, 1923, I moved into Exham Priory after the last workman had finished his labours"
186,176-200,35,031-035,"The restoration had been a stupendous task, for little had remained of the deserted pile but a shell-like ruin; yet because it had been the seat of my ancestors I let no expense deter me"
346,more,59,056-060,"The place had not been inhabited since the reign of James the First, when a tragedy of intensely hideous, though largely unexplained, nature had struck down the master, five of his children, and several servants; and driven forth under a cloud of suspicion and terror the third son, my lineal progenitor and the only survivor of the abhorred line"
167,151-175,30,026-030,"With this sole heir denounced as a murderer, the estate had reverted to the crown, nor had the accused man made any attempt to exculpate himself or regain his property"
300,more,53,051-055,"Shaken by some horror greater than that of conscience or the law, and expressing only a frantic wish to exclude the ancient edifice from his sight and memory, Walter de la Poer, eleventh Baron Exham, fled to Virginia and there founded the family which by the next century had become known as Delapore"
387,more,60,056-060,"Exham Priory had remained untenanted, though later allotted to the estates of the Norrys family and much studied because of its peculiarly composite architecture; an architecture involving Gothic towers resting on a Saxon or Romanesque substructure, whose foundation in turn was of a still earlier order or blend of orders—Roman, and even Druidic or native Cymric, if legends speak truly"
211,201-225,36,036-040,"This foundation was a very singular thing, being merged on one side with the solid limestone of the precipice from whose brink the priory overlooked a desolate valley three miles west of the village of Anchester"
117,101-125,18,016-020,"Architects and antiquarians loved to examine this strange relic of forgotten centuries, but the country folk hated it"
142,126-150,27,026-030,"They had hated it hundreds of years before, when my ancestors lived there, and they hated it now, with the moss and mould of abandonment on it"
75,076-010,17,016-020,"I had not been a day in Anchester before I knew I came of an accursed house"
105,101-125,18,016-020,"And this week workmen have blown up Exham Priory, and are busy obliterating the traces of its foundations"
155,151-175,28,026-030,"The bare statistics of my ancestry I had always known, together with the fact that my first American forbear had come to the colonies under a strange cloud"
119,101-125,19,016-020,"Of details, however, I had been kept wholly ignorant through the policy of reticence always maintained by the Delapores"
297,more,49,046-050,"Unlike our planter neighbours, we seldom boasted of crusading ancestors or other mediaeval and Renaissance heroes; nor was any kind of tradition handed down except what may have been recorded in the sealed envelope left before the Civil War by every squire to his eldest son for posthumous opening"
152,151-175,24,021-025,"The glories we cherished were those achieved since the migration; the glories of a proud and honourable, if somewhat reserved and unsocial Virginia line"
138,126-150,25,021-025,"During the war our fortunes were extinguished and our whole existence changed by the burning of Carfax, our home on the banks of the James"
131,126-150,23,021-025,"My grandfather, advanced in years, had perished in that incendiary outrage, and with him the envelope that bound us all to the past"
159,151-175,30,026-030,"I can recall that fire today as I saw it then at the age of seven, with the Federal soldiers shouting, the women screaming, and the natives howling and praying"
131,126-150,24,021-025,"My father was in the army, defending Richmond, and after many formalities my mother and I were passed through the lines to join him"
139,126-150,27,026-030,"When the war ended we all moved north, whence my mother had come; and I grew to manhood, middle age, and ultimate wealth as a stolid Yankee"
229,226-250,40,036-040,"Neither my father nor I ever knew what our hereditary envelope had contained, and as I merged into the greyness of Massachusetts business life I lost all interest in the mysteries which evidently lurked far back in my family tree"
102,101-125,19,016-020,"Had I suspected their nature, how gladly I would have left Exham Priory to its moss, bats, and cobwebs"
113,101-125,23,021-025,"My father died in 1904, but without any message to leave me, or to my only child, Alfred, a motherless boy of ten"
256,251-275,46,046-050,"It was this boy who reversed the order of family information; for although I could give him only jesting conjectures about the past, he wrote me of some very interesting ancestral legends when the late war took him to England in 1917 as an aviation officer"
101,101-125,17,016-020,"Apparently the Delapores had a colourful and perhaps sinister history, for a friend of my son’s, Capt"
182,176-200,28,026-030,"Edward Norrys of the Royal Flying Corps, dwelt near the family seat at Anchester and related some peasant superstitions which few novelists could equal for wildness and incredibility"
123,101-125,23,021-025,"Norrys himself, of course, did not take them seriously; but they amused my son and made good material for his letters to me"
313,more,52,051-055,"It was this legendry which definitely turned my attention to my transatlantic heritage, and made me resolve to purchase and restore the family seat which Norrys shewed to Alfred in its picturesque desertion, and offered to get for him at a surprisingly reasonable figure, since his own uncle was the present owner"
141,126-150,26,026-030,"I bought Exham Priory in 1918, but was almost immediately distracted from my plans of restoration by the return of my son as a maimed invalid"
132,126-150,24,021-025,"During the two years that he lived I thought of nothing but his care, having even placed my business under the direction of partners"
151,151-175,26,026-030,"In 1921, as I found myself bereaved and aimless, a retired manufacturer no longer young, I resolved to divert my remaining years with my new possession"
57,051-075,9,009-010,"Visiting Anchester in December, I was entertained by Capt"
161,151-175,28,026-030,"Norrys, a plump, amiable young man who had thought much of my son, and secured his assistance in gathering plans and anecdotes to guide in the coming restoration"
266,251-275,42,041-045,"Exham Priory itself I saw without emotion, a jumble of tottering mediaeval ruins covered with lichens and honeycombed with rooks’ nests, perched perilously upon a precipice, and denuded of floors or other interior features save the stone walls of the separate towers"
165,151-175,30,026-030,"As I gradually recovered the image of the edifice as it had been when my ancestor left it over three centuries before, I began to hire workmen for the reconstruction"
148,126-150,26,026-030,"In every case I was forced to go outside the immediate locality, for the Anchester villagers had an almost unbelievable fear and hatred of the place"
193,176-200,30,026-030,"This sentiment was so great that it was sometimes communicated to the outside labourers, causing numerous desertions; whilst its scope appeared to include both the priory and its ancient family"
217,201-225,43,041-045,"My son had told me that he was somewhat avoided during his visits because he was a de la Poer, and I now found myself subtly ostracised for a like reason until I convinced the peasants how little I knew of my heritage"
124,101-125,22,021-025,"Even then they sullenly disliked me, so that I had to collect most of the village traditions through the mediation of Norrys"
208,201-225,38,036-040,"What the people could not forgive, perhaps, was that I had come to restore a symbol so abhorrent to them; for, rationally or not, they viewed Exham Priory as nothing less than a haunt of fiends and werewolves"
301,more,48,046-050,"Piecing together the tales which Norrys collected for me, and supplementing them with the accounts of several savants who had studied the ruins, I deduced that Exham Priory stood on the site of a prehistoric temple; a Druidical or ante-Druidical thing which must have been contemporary with Stonehenge"
187,176-200,28,026-030,"That indescribable rites had been celebrated there, few doubted; and there were unpleasant tales of the transference of these rites into the Cybele-worship which the Romans had introduced"
83,076-010,12,011-015,"Inscriptions still visible in the sub-cellar bore such unmistakable letters as “DIV"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"OPS"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"MAGNA"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"MAT"
88,076-010,16,016-020,"” sign of the Magna Mater whose dark worship was once vainly forbidden to Roman citizens"
236,226-250,40,036-040,"Anchester had been the camp of the third Augustan legion, as many remains attest, and it was said that the temple of Cybele was splendid and thronged with worshippers who performed nameless ceremonies at the bidding of a Phrygian priest"
150,126-150,30,026-030,"Tales added that the fall of the old religion did not end the orgies at the temple, but that the priests lived on in the new faith without real change"
270,251-275,48,046-050,"Likewise was it said that the rites did not vanish with the Roman power, and that certain among the Saxons added to what remained of the temple, and gave it the essential outline it subsequently preserved, making it the centre of a cult feared through half the heptarchy"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"About 1000 A"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"D"
210,201-225,34,031-035,"the place is mentioned in a chronicle as being a substantial stone priory housing a strange and powerful monastic order and surrounded by extensive gardens which needed no walls to exclude a frightened populace"
236,226-250,41,041-045,"It was never destroyed by the Danes, though after the Norman Conquest it must have declined tremendously; since there was no impediment when Henry the Third granted the site to my ancestor, Gilbert de la Poer, First Baron Exham, in 1261"
100,076-010,18,016-020,"Of my family before this date there is no evil report, but something strange must have happened then"
226,226-250,45,041-045,"In one chronicle there is a reference to a de la Poer as “cursed of God” in 1307, whilst village legendry had nothing but evil and frantic fear to tell of the castle that went up on the foundations of the old temple and priory"
134,126-150,20,016-020,"The fireside tales were of the most grisly description, all the ghastlier because of their frightened reticence and cloudy evasiveness"
264,251-275,40,036-040,"They represented my ancestors as a race of hereditary daemons beside whom Gilles de Retz and the Marquis de Sade would seem the veriest tyros, and hinted whisperingly at their responsibility for the occasional disappearance of villagers through several generations"
114,101-125,18,016-020,"The worst characters, apparently, were the barons and their direct heirs; at least, most was whispered about these"
126,126-150,22,021-025,"If of healthier inclinations, it was said, an heir would early and mysteriously die to make way for another more typical scion"
132,126-150,26,026-030,"There seemed to be an inner cult in the family, presided over by the head of the house, and sometimes closed except to a few members"
128,126-150,22,021-025,"Temperament rather than ancestry was evidently the basis of this cult, for it was entered by several who married into the family"
248,226-250,42,041-045,"Lady Margaret Trevor from Cornwall, wife of Godfrey, the second son of the fifth baron, became a favourite bane of children all over the countryside, and the daemon heroine of a particularly horrible old ballad not yet extinct near the Welsh border"
328,more,60,056-060,"Preserved in balladry, too, though not illustrating the same point, is the hideous tale of Lady Mary de la Poer, who shortly after her marriage to the Earl of Shrewsfield was killed by him and his mother, both of the slayers being absolved and blessed by the priest to whom they confessed what they dared not repeat to the world"
88,076-010,14,011-015,"These myths and ballads, typical as they were of crude superstition, repelled me greatly"
377,more,60,056-060,"Their persistence, and their application to so long a line of my ancestors, were especially annoying; whilst the imputations of monstrous habits proved unpleasantly reminiscent of the one known scandal of my immediate forbears—the case of my cousin, young Randolph Delapore of Carfax, who went among the natives and became a voodoo priest after he returned from the Mexican War"
380,more,71,more,"I was much less disturbed by the vaguer tales of wails and howlings in the barren, windswept valley beneath the limestone cliff; of the graveyard stenches after the spring rains; of the floundering, squealing white thing on which Sir John Clave’s horse had trod one night in a lonely field; and of the servant who had gone mad at what he saw in the priory in the full light of day"
86,076-010,15,011-015,"These things were hackneyed spectral lore, and I was at that time a pronounced sceptic"
122,101-125,19,016-020,"The accounts of vanished peasants were less to be dismissed, though not especially significant in view of mediaeval custom"
132,126-150,20,016-020,"Prying curiosity meant death, and more than one severed head had been publicly shewn on the bastions—now effaced—around Exham Priory"
120,101-125,22,021-025,"A few of the tales were exceedingly picturesque, and made me wish I had learnt more of comparative mythology in my youth"
239,226-250,36,036-040,"There was, for instance, the belief that a legion of bat-winged devils kept Witches’ Sabbath each night at the priory—a legion whose sustenance might explain the disproportionate abundance of coarse vegetables harvested in the vast gardens"
364,more,63,more,"And, most vivid of all, there was the dramatic epic of the rats—the scampering army of obscene vermin which had burst forth from the castle three months after the tragedy that doomed it to desertion—the lean, filthy, ravenous army which had swept all before it and devoured fowl, cats, dogs, hogs, sheep, and even two hapless human beings before its fury was spent"
164,151-175,27,026-030,"Around that unforgettable rodent army a whole separate cycle of myths revolves, for it scattered among the village homes and brought curses and horrors in its train"
128,126-150,23,021-025,"Such was the lore that assailed me as I pushed to completion, with an elderly obstinacy, the work of restoring my ancestral home"
99,076-010,16,016-020,"It must not be imagined for a moment that these tales formed my principal psychological environment"
66,076-010,12,011-015,"On the other hand, I was constantly praised and encouraged by Capt"
55,051-075,9,009-010,"Norrys and the antiquarians who surrounded and aided me"
248,226-250,38,036-040,"When the task was done, over two years after its commencement, I viewed the great rooms, wainscotted walls, vaulted ceilings, mullioned windows, and broad staircases with a pride which fully compensated for the prodigious expense of the restoration"
136,126-150,21,021-025,"Every attribute of the Middle Ages was cunningly reproduced, and the new parts blended perfectly with the original walls and foundations"
123,101-125,25,021-025,"The seat of my fathers was complete, and I looked forward to redeeming at last the local fame of the line which ended in me"
140,126-150,28,026-030,"I would reside here permanently, and prove that a de la Poer (for I had adopted again the original spelling of the name) need not be a fiend"
179,176-200,31,031-035,"My comfort was perhaps augmented by the fact that, although Exham Priory was mediaevally fitted, its interior was in truth wholly new and free from old vermin and old ghosts alike"
43,051-075,11,011-015,"As I have said, I moved in on July 16, 1923"
102,101-125,17,016-020,"My household consisted of seven servants and nine cats, of which latter species I am particularly fond"
158,151-175,28,026-030,"My eldest cat, 'Tiddles', was seven years old and had come with me from my home in Bolton, Massachusetts; the others I had accumulated whilst living with Capt"
51,051-075,8,006-008,"Norrys’ family during the restoration of the priory"
128,126-150,22,021-025,"For five days our routine proceeded with the utmost placidity, my time being spent mostly in the codification of old family data"
203,201-225,37,036-040,"I had now obtained some very circumstantial accounts of the final tragedy and flight of Walter de la Poer, which I conceived to be the probable contents of the hereditary paper lost in the fire at Carfax"
374,more,61,more,"It appeared that my ancestor was accused with much reason of having killed all the other members of his household, except four servant confederates, in their sleep, about two weeks after a shocking discovery which changed his whole demeanour, but which, except by implication, he disclosed to no one save perhaps the servants who assisted him and afterward fled beyond reach"
324,more,50,046-050,"This deliberate slaughter, which included a father, three brothers, and two sisters, was largely condoned by the villagers, and so slackly treated by the law that its perpetrator escaped honoured, unharmed, and undisguised to Virginia; the general whispered sentiment being that he had purged the land of an immemorial curse"
80,076-010,13,011-015,"What discovery had prompted an act so terrible, I could scarcely even conjecture"
140,126-150,26,026-030,"Walter de la Poer must have known for years the sinister tales about his family, so that this material could have given him no fresh impulse"
135,126-150,22,021-025,"Had he, then, witnessed some appalling ancient rite, or stumbled upon some frightful and revealing symbol in the priory or its vicinity"
58,051-075,12,011-015,"He was reputed to have been a shy, gentle youth in England"
77,076-010,14,011-015,"In Virginia he seemed not so much hard or bitter as harassed and apprehensive"
143,126-150,23,021-025,"He was spoken of in the diary of another gentleman-adventurer, Francis Harley of Bellview, as a man of unexampled justice, honour, and delicacy"
149,126-150,24,021-025,"On July 22 occurred the first incident which, though lightly dismissed at the time, takes on a preternatural significance in relation to later events"
324,more,55,051-055,"It was so simple as to be almost negligible, and could not possibly have been noticed under the circumstances; for it must be recalled that since I was in a building practically fresh and new except for the walls, and surrounded by a well-balanced staff of servitors, apprehension would have been absurd despite the locality"
189,176-200,33,031-035,"What I afterward remembered is merely this—that my old black cat, whose moods I know so well, was undoubtedly alert and anxious to an extent wholly out of keeping with his natural character"
136,126-150,23,021-025,"He roved from room to room, restless and disturbed, and sniffed constantly about the walls which formed part of the old Gothic structure"
175,151-175,28,026-030,"I realise how trite this sounds—like the inevitable dog in the ghost story, which always growls before his master sees the sheeted figure—yet I cannot consistently suppress it"
86,076-010,15,011-015,"The following day a servant complained of restlessness among all the cats in the house"
338,more,61,more,"He came to me in my study, a lofty west room on the second story, with groined arches, black oak panelling, and a triple Gothic window overlooking the limestone cliff and desolate valley; and even as he spoke I saw the jetty form of Nigger-Man creeping along the west wall and scratching at the new panels which overlaid the ancient stone"
193,176-200,33,031-035,"I told the man that there must be some singular odour or emanation from the old stonework, imperceptible to human senses, but affecting the delicate organs of cats even through the new woodwork"
293,more,54,051-055,"This I truly believed, and when the fellow suggested the presence of mice or rats, I mentioned that there had been no rats there for three hundred years, and that even the field mice of the surrounding country could hardly be found in these high walls, where they had never been known to stray"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"That afternoon I called on Capt"
138,126-150,25,021-025,"Norrys, and he assured me that it would be quite incredible for field mice to infest the priory in such a sudden and unprecedented fashion"
229,226-250,40,036-040,"That night, dispensing as usual with a valet, I retired in the west tower chamber which I had chosen as my own, reached from the study by a stone staircase and short gallery—the former partly ancient, the latter entirely restored"
118,101-125,20,016-020,"This room was circular, very high, and without wainscotting, being hung with arras which I had myself chosen in London"
298,more,50,046-050,"Seeing that Nigger-Man was with me, I shut the heavy Gothic door and retired by the light of the electric bulbs which so cleverly counterfeited candles, finally switching off the light and sinking on the carved and canopied four-poster, with the venerable cat in his accustomed place across my feet"
83,076-010,17,016-020,"I did not draw the curtains, but gazed out at the narrow north window which I faced"
112,101-125,19,016-020,"There was a suspicion of aurora in the sky, and the delicate traceries of the window were pleasantly silhouetted"
160,151-175,28,026-030,"At some time I must have fallen quietly asleep, for I recall a distinct sense of leaving strange dreams, when the cat started violently from his placid position"
114,101-125,21,021-025,"I saw him in the faint auroral glow, head strained forward, fore feet on my ankles, and hind feet stretched behind"
175,151-175,35,031-035,"He was looking intensely at a point on the wall somewhat west of the window, a point which to my eye had nothing to mark it, but toward which all my attention was now directed"
63,076-010,12,011-015,"And as I watched, I knew that Nigger-Man was not vainly excited"
45,051-075,8,006-008,"Whether the arras actually moved I cannot say"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"I think it did, very slightly"
94,076-010,21,021-025,"But what I can swear to is that behind it I heard a low, distinct scurrying as of rats or mice"
252,251-275,45,041-045,"In a moment the cat had jumped bodily on the screening tapestry, bringing the affected section to the floor with his weight, and exposing a damp, ancient wall of stone; patched here and there by the restorers, and devoid of any trace of rodent prowlers"
172,151-175,33,031-035,"Nigger-Man raced up and down the floor by this part of the wall, clawing the fallen arras and seemingly trying at times to insert a paw between the wall and the oaken floor"
79,076-010,15,011-015,"He found nothing, and after a time returned wearily to his place across my feet"
53,051-075,12,011-015,"I had not moved, but I did not sleep again that night"
189,176-200,34,031-035,"In the morning I questioned all the servants, and found that none of them had noticed anything unusual, save that the cook remembered the actions of a cat which had rested on her windowsill"
153,151-175,31,031-035,"This cat had howled at some unknown hour of the night, awaking the cook in time for her to see him dart purposefully out of the open door down the stairs"
70,076-010,13,011-015,"I drowsed away the noontime, and in the afternoon called again on Capt"
60,051-075,10,009-010,"Norrys, who became exceedingly interested in what I told him"
154,151-175,25,021-025,"The odd incidents—so slight yet so curious—appealed to his sense of the picturesque, and elicited from him a number of reminiscences of local ghostly lore"
170,151-175,30,026-030,"We were genuinely perplexed at the presence of rats, and Norrys lent me some traps and Paris green, which I had the servants place in strategic localities when I returned"
88,076-010,16,016-020,"I retired early, being very sleepy, but was harassed by dreams of the most horrible sort"
247,226-250,40,036-040,"I seemed to be looking down from an immense height upon a twilit grotto, knee-deep with filth, where a white-bearded daemon swineherd drove about with his staff a flock of fungous, flabby beasts whose appearance filled me with unutterable loathing"
155,151-175,29,026-030,"Then, as the swineherd paused and nodded over his task, a mighty swarm of rats rained down on the stinking abyss and fell to devouring beasts and man alike"
123,101-125,22,021-025,"From this terrific vision I was abruptly awaked by the motions of Nigger-Man, who had been sleeping as usual across my feet"
289,more,52,051-055,"This time I did not have to question the source of his snarls and hisses, and of the fear which made him sink his claws into my ankle, unconscious of their effect; for on every side of the chamber the walls were alive with nauseous sound—the verminous slithering of ravenous, gigantic rats"
152,151-175,29,026-030,"There was now no aurora to shew the state of the arras—the fallen section of which had been replaced—but I was not too frightened to switch on the light"
154,151-175,27,026-030,"As the bulbs leapt into radiance I saw a hideous shaking all over the tapestry, causing the somewhat peculiar designs to execute a singular dance of death"
61,051-075,11,011-015,"This motion disappeared almost at once, and the sound with it"
145,126-150,28,026-030,"Springing out of bed, I poked at the arras with the long handle of a warming-pan that rested near, and lifted one section to see what lay beneath"
115,101-125,20,016-020,"There was nothing but the patched stone wall, and even the cat had lost his tense realisation of abnormal presences"
168,151-175,32,031-035,"When I examined the circular trap that had been placed in the room, I found all of the openings sprung, though no trace remained of what had been caught and had escaped"
171,151-175,32,031-035,"Further sleep was out of the question, so, lighting a candle, I opened the door and went out in the gallery toward the stairs to my study, Nigger-Man following at my heels"
111,101-125,20,016-020,"Before we had reached the stone steps, however, the cat darted ahead of me and vanished down the ancient flight"
139,126-150,26,026-030,"As I descended the stairs myself, I became suddenly aware of sounds in the great room below; sounds of a nature which could not be mistaken"
137,126-150,22,021-025,"The oak-panelled walls were alive with rats, scampering and milling, whilst Nigger-Man was racing about with the fury of a baffled hunter"
96,076-010,18,016-020,"Reaching the bottom, I switched on the light, which did not this time cause the noise to subside"
140,126-150,22,021-025,"The rats continued their riot, stampeding with such force and distinctness that I could finally assign to their motions a definite direction"
172,151-175,22,021-025,"These creatures, in numbers apparently inexhaustible, were engaged in one stupendous migration from inconceivable heights to some depth conceivably, or inconceivably, below"
98,076-010,18,016-020,"I now heard steps in the corridor, and in another moment two servants pushed open the massive door"
252,251-275,42,041-045,"They were searching the house for some unknown source of disturbance which had thrown all the cats into a snarling panic and caused them to plunge precipitately down several flights of stairs and squat, yowling, before the closed door to the sub-cellar"
73,076-010,15,011-015,"I asked them if they had heard the rats, but they replied in the negative"
107,101-125,21,021-025,"And when I turned to call their attention to the sounds in the panels, I realised that the noise had ceased"
97,076-010,19,016-020,"With the two men, I went down to the door of the sub-cellar, but found the cats already dispersed"
99,076-010,20,016-020,"Later I resolved to explore the crypt below, but for the present I merely made a round of the traps"
40,026-050,7,006-008,"All were sprung, yet all were tenantless"
214,201-225,37,036-040,"Satisfying myself that no one had heard the rats save the felines and me, I sat in my study till morning; thinking profoundly, and recalling every scrap of legend I had unearthed concerning the building I inhabited"
134,126-150,23,021-025,"I slept some in the forenoon, leaning back in the one comfortable library chair which my mediaeval plan of furnishing could not banish"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"Later I telephoned to Capt"
58,051-075,10,009-010,"Norrys, who came over and helped me explore the sub-cellar"
135,126-150,23,021-025,"Absolutely nothing untoward was found, although we could not repress a thrill at the knowledge that this vault was built by Roman hands"
289,more,45,041-045,"Every low arch and massive pillar was Roman—not the debased Romanesque of the bungling Saxons, but the severe and harmonious classicism of the age of the Caesars; indeed, the walls abounded with inscriptions familiar to the antiquarians who had repeatedly explored the place—things like “P"

168,151-175,32,031-035,"The reference to Atys made me shiver, for I had read Catullus and knew something of the hideous rites of the Eastern god, whose worship was so mixed with that of Cybele"
204,201-225,35,031-035,"Norrys and I, by the light of lanterns, tried to interpret the odd and nearly effaced designs on certain irregularly rectangular blocks of stone generally held to be altars, but could make nothing of them"
239,226-250,42,041-045,"We remembered that one pattern, a sort of rayed sun, was held by students to imply a non-Roman origin, suggesting that these altars had merely been adopted by the Roman priests from some older and perhaps aboriginal temple on the same site"
66,076-010,13,011-015,"On one of these blocks were some brown stains which made me wonder"
146,126-150,23,021-025,"The largest, in the centre of the room, had certain features on the upper surface which indicated its connexion with fire—probably burnt offerings"
129,126-150,25,021-025,"Such were the sights in that crypt before whose door the cats had howled, and where Norrys and I now determined to pass the night"
169,151-175,30,026-030,"Couches were brought down by the servants, who were told not to mind any nocturnal actions of the cats, and Nigger-Man was admitted as much for help as for companionship"
194,176-200,31,031-035,"We decided to keep the great oak door—a modern replica with slits for ventilation—tightly closed; and, with this attended to, we retired with lanterns still burning to await whatever might occur"
155,151-175,27,026-030,"The vault was very deep in the foundations of the priory, and undoubtedly far down on the face of the beetling limestone cliff overlooking the waste valley"
113,101-125,22,021-025,"That it had been the goal of the scuffling and unexplainable rats I could not doubt, though why, I could not tell"
159,151-175,28,026-030,"As we lay there expectantly, I found my vigil occasionally mixed with half-formed dreams from which the uneasy motions of the cat across my feet would rouse me"
85,076-010,16,016-020,"These dreams were not wholesome, but horribly like the one I had had the night before"
230,226-250,38,036-040,"I saw again the twilit grotto, and the swineherd with his unmentionable fungous beasts wallowing in filth, and as I looked at these things they seemed nearer and more distinct—so distinct that I could almost observe their features"
123,101-125,22,021-025,"Then I did observe the flabby features of one of them—and awaked with such a scream that Nigger-Man started up, whilst Capt"
47,051-075,7,006-008,"Norrys, who had not slept, laughed considerably"
91,076-010,16,016-020,"Norrys might have laughed more—or perhaps less—had he known what it was that made me scream"
40,026-050,8,006-008,"But I did not remember myself till later"
56,051-075,9,009-010,"Ultimate horror often paralyses memory in a merciful way"
40,026-050,7,006-008,"Norrys waked me when the phenomena began"
103,101-125,21,021-025,"Out of the same frightful dream I was called by his gentle shaking and his urging to listen to the cats"
343,more,60,056-060,"Indeed, there was much to listen to, for beyond the closed door at the head of the stone steps was a veritable nightmare of feline yelling and clawing, whilst Nigger-Man, unmindful of his kindred outside, was running excitedly around the bare stone walls, in which I heard the same babel of scurrying rats that had troubled me the night before"
99,076-010,17,016-020,"An acute terror now rose within me, for here were anomalies which nothing normal could well explain"
172,151-175,33,031-035,"These rats, if not the creatures of a madness which I shared with the cats alone, must be burrowing and sliding in Roman walls I had thought to be of solid limestone blocks"
143,126-150,23,021-025,"unless perhaps the action of water through more than seventeen centuries had eaten winding tunnels which rodent bodies had worn clear and ample"
128,126-150,23,021-025,"But even so, the spectral horror was no less; for if these were living vermin why did not Norrys hear their disgusting commotion"
142,126-150,28,026-030,"Why did he urge me to watch Nigger-Man and listen to the cats outside, and why did he guess wildly and vaguely at what could have aroused them"
309,more,56,056-060,"By the time I had managed to tell him, as rationally as I could, what I thought I was hearing, my ears gave me the last fading impression of the scurrying; which had retreated still downward, far underneath this deepest of sub-cellars till it seemed as if the whole cliff below were riddled with questing rats"
85,076-010,14,011-015,"Norrys was not as sceptical as I had anticipated, but instead seemed profoundly moved"
308,more,57,056-060,"He motioned to me to notice that the cats at the door had ceased their clamour, as if giving up the rats for lost; whilst Nigger-Man had a burst of renewed restlessness, and was clawing frantically around the bottom of the large stone altar in the centre of the room, which was nearer Norrys’ couch than mine"
51,051-075,11,011-015,"My fear of the unknown was at this point very great"
54,051-075,9,009-010,"Something astounding had occurred, and I saw that Capt"
188,176-200,27,026-030,"Norrys, a younger, stouter, and presumably more naturally materialistic man, was affected fully as much as myself—perhaps because of his lifelong and intimate familiarity with local legend"
254,251-275,49,046-050,"We could for the moment do nothing but watch the old black cat as he pawed with decreasing fervour at the base of the altar, occasionally looking up and mewing to me in that persuasive manner which he used when he wished me to perform some favour for him"
223,201-225,36,036-040,"Norrys now took a lantern close to the altar and examined the place where Nigger-Man was pawing; silently kneeling and scraping away the lichens of centuries which joined the massive pre-Roman block to the tessellated floor"
186,176-200,33,031-035,"He did not find anything, and was about to abandon his effort when I noticed a trivial circumstance which made me shudder, even though it implied nothing more than I had already imagined"
140,126-150,22,021-025,"I told him of it, and we both looked at its almost imperceptible manifestation with the fixedness of fascinated discovery and acknowledgment"
275,251-275,48,046-050,"It was only this—that the flame of the lantern set down near the altar was slightly but certainly flickering from a draught of air which it had not before received, and which came indubitably from the crevice between floor and altar where Norrys was scraping away the lichens"
108,101-125,19,016-020,"We spent the rest of the night in the brilliantly lighted study, nervously discussing what we should do next"
258,251-275,39,036-040,"The discovery that some vault deeper than the deepest known masonry of the Romans underlay this accursed pile—some vault unsuspected by the curious antiquarians of three centuries—would have been sufficient to excite us without any background of the sinister"
250,226-250,43,041-045,"As it was, the fascination became twofold; and we paused in doubt whether to abandon our search and quit the priory forever in superstitious caution, or to gratify our sense of adventure and brave whatever horrors might await us in the unknown depths"
142,126-150,26,026-030,"By morning we had compromised, and decided to go to London to gather a group of archaeologists and scientific men fit to cope with the mystery"
169,151-175,32,031-035,"It should be mentioned that before leaving the sub-cellar we had vainly tried to move the central altar which we now recognised as the gate to a new pit of nameless fear"
69,076-010,14,011-015,"What secret would open the gate, wiser men than we would have to find"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"During many days in London Capt"
202,201-225,30,026-030,"Norrys and I presented our facts, conjectures, and legendary anecdotes to five eminent authorities, all men who could be trusted to respect any family disclosures which future explorations might develop"
106,101-125,16,016-020,"We found most of them little disposed to scoff, but instead intensely interested and sincerely sympathetic"
164,151-175,31,031-035,"It is hardly necessary to name them all, but I may say that they included Sir William Brinton, whose excavations in the Troad excited most of the world in their day"
241,226-250,44,041-045,"As we all took the train for Anchester I felt myself poised on the brink of frightful revelations, a sensation symbolised by the air of mourning among the many Americans at the unexpected death of the President on the other side of the world"
117,101-125,20,016-020,"On the evening of August 7th we reached Exham Priory, where the servants assured me that nothing unusual had occurred"
101,101-125,19,016-020,"The cats, even old Nigger-Man, had been perfectly placid; and not a trap in the house had been sprung"
112,101-125,19,016-020,"We were to begin exploring on the following day, awaiting which I assigned well-appointed rooms to all my guests"
72,076-010,13,011-015,"I myself retired in my own tower chamber, with Nigger-Man across my feet"
50,051-075,8,006-008,"Sleep came quickly, but hideous dreams assailed me"
95,076-010,19,016-020,"There was a vision of a Roman feast like that of Trimalchio, with a horror in a covered platter"
102,101-125,17,016-020,"Then came that damnable, recurrent thing about the swineherd and his filthy drove in the twilit grotto"
76,076-010,15,011-015,"Yet when I awoke it was full daylight, with normal sounds in the house below"
84,076-010,14,011-015,"The rats, living or spectral, had not troubled me; and Nigger-Man was quietly asleep"
281,more,48,046-050,"On going down, I found that the same tranquillity had prevailed elsewhere; a condition which one of the assembled savants—a fellow named Thornton, devoted to the psychic—rather absurdly laid to the fact that I had now been shewn the thing which certain forces had wished to shew me"
30,026-050,8,006-008,"All was now ready, and at 11 a"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"m"
157,151-175,25,021-025,"our entire group of seven men, bearing powerful electric searchlights and implements of excavation, went down to the sub-cellar and bolted the door behind us"
176,176-200,28,026-030,"Nigger-Man was with us, for the investigators found no occasion to despise his excitability, and were indeed anxious that he be present in case of obscure rodent manifestations"
154,151-175,25,021-025,"We noted the Roman inscriptions and unknown altar designs only briefly, for three of the savants had already seen them, and all knew their characteristics"
177,176-200,29,026-030,"Prime attention was paid to the momentous central altar, and within an hour Sir William Brinton had caused it to tilt backward, balanced by some unknown species of counterweight"
90,076-010,17,016-020,"There now lay revealed such a horror as would have overwhelmed us had we not been prepared"
220,201-225,40,036-040,"Through a nearly square opening in the tiled floor, sprawling on a flight of stone steps so prodigiously worn that it was little more than an inclined plane at the centre, was a ghastly array of human or semi-human bones"
129,126-150,21,021-025,"Those which retained their collocation as skeletons shewed attitudes of panic fear, and over all were the marks of rodent gnawing"
85,076-010,12,011-015,"The skulls denoted nothing short of utter idiocy, cretinism, or primitive semi-apedom"
135,126-150,21,021-025,"Above the hellishly littered steps arched a descending passage seemingly chiselled from the solid rock, and conducting a current of air"
122,101-125,24,021-025,"This current was not a sudden and noxious rush as from a closed vault, but a cool breeze with something of freshness in it"
78,076-010,15,011-015,"We did not pause long, but shiveringly began to clear a passage down the steps"
179,176-200,30,026-030,"It was then that Sir William, examining the hewn walls, made the odd observation that the passage, according to the direction of the strokes, must have been chiselled from beneath"
50,051-075,10,009-010,"I must be very deliberate now, and choose my words"
243,226-250,41,041-045,"After ploughing down a few steps amidst the gnawed bones we saw that there was light ahead; not any mystic phosphorescence, but a filtered daylight which could not come except from unknown fissures in the cliff that overlooked the waste valley"
211,201-225,37,036-040,"That such fissures had escaped notice from outside was hardly remarkable, for not only is the valley wholly uninhabited, but the cliff is so high and beetling that only an aëronaut could study its face in detail"
202,201-225,36,036-040,"A few steps more, and our breaths were literally snatched from us by what we saw; so literally that Thornton, the psychic investigator, actually fainted in the arms of the dazed man who stood behind him"
151,151-175,28,026-030,"Norrys, his plump face utterly white and flabby, simply cried out inarticulately; whilst I think that what I did was to gasp or hiss, and cover my eyes"
86,076-010,16,016-020,"The man behind me—the only one of the party older than I—croaked the hackneyed “My God"
40,026-050,9,009-010,"” in the most cracked voice I ever heard"
160,151-175,29,026-030,"Of seven cultivated men, only Sir William Brinton retained his composure; a thing more to his credit because he led the party and must have seen the sight first"
157,151-175,25,021-025,"It was a twilit grotto of enormous height, stretching away farther than any eye could see; a subterraneous world of limitless mystery and horrible suggestion"
324,more,53,051-055,"There were buildings and other architectural remains—in one terrified glance I saw a weird pattern of tumuli, a savage circle of monoliths, a low-domed Roman ruin, a sprawling Saxon pile, and an early English edifice of wood—but all these were dwarfed by the ghoulish spectacle presented by the general surface of the ground"
116,101-125,23,021-025,"For yards about the steps extended an insane tangle of human bones, or bones at least as human as those on the steps"
240,226-250,37,036-040,"Like a foamy sea they stretched, some fallen apart, but others wholly or partly articulated as skeletons; these latter invariably in postures of daemoniac frenzy, either fighting off some menace or clutching other forms with cannibal intent"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"When Dr"
112,101-125,17,016-020,"Trask, the anthropologist, stooped to classify the skulls, he found a degraded mixture which utterly baffled him"
106,101-125,19,016-020,"They were mostly lower than the Piltdown man in the scale of evolution, but in every case definitely human"
102,101-125,18,016-020,"Many were of higher grade, and a very few were the skulls of supremely and sensitively developed types"
89,076-010,16,016-020,"All the bones were gnawed, mostly by rats, but somewhat by others of the half-human drove"
108,101-125,19,016-020,"Mixed with them were many tiny bones of rats—fallen members of the lethal army which closed the ancient epic"
94,076-010,18,016-020,"I wonder that any man among us lived and kept his sanity through that hideous day of discovery"
407,more,65,more,"Not Hoffmann or Huysmans could conceive a scene more wildly incredible, more frenetically repellent, or more Gothically grotesque than the twilit grotto through which we seven staggered; each stumbling on revelation after revelation, and trying to keep for the nonce from thinking of the events which must have taken place there three hundred years, or a thousand, or two thousand, or ten thousand years ago"
194,176-200,33,031-035,"It was the antechamber of hell, and poor Thornton fainted again when Trask told him that some of the skeleton things must have descended as quadrupeds through the last twenty or more generations"
73,076-010,12,011-015,"Horror piled on horror as we began to interpret the architectural remains"
181,176-200,30,026-030,"The quadruped things—with their occasional recruits from the biped class—had been kept in stone pens, out of which they must have broken in their last delirium of hunger or rat-fear"
189,176-200,34,031-035,"There had been great herds of them, evidently fattened on the coarse vegetables whose remains could be found as a sort of poisonous ensilage at the bottom of huge stone bins older than Rome"
89,076-010,16,016-020,"I knew now why my ancestors had had such excessive gardens—would to heaven I could forget"
46,051-075,11,011-015,"The purpose of the herds I did not have to ask"
229,226-250,40,036-040,"Sir William, standing with his searchlight in the Roman ruin, translated aloud the most shocking ritual I have ever known; and told of the diet of the antediluvian cult which the priests of Cybele found and mingled with their own"
104,101-125,20,016-020,"Norrys, used as he was to the trenches, could not walk straight when he came out of the English building"
194,176-200,35,031-035,"It was a butcher shop and kitchen—he had expected that—but it was too much to see familiar English implements in such a place, and to read familiar English graffiti there, some as recent as 1610"
134,126-150,24,021-025,"I could not go in that building—that building whose daemon activities were stopped only by the dagger of my ancestor Walter de la Poer"
152,151-175,30,026-030,"What I did venture to enter was the low Saxon building, whose oaken door had fallen, and there I found a terrible row of ten stone cells with rusty bars"
126,126-150,24,021-025,"Three had tenants, all skeletons of high grade, and on the bony forefinger of one I found a seal ring with my own coat-of-arms"
97,076-010,18,016-020,"Sir William found a vault with far older cells below the Roman chapel, but these cells were empty"
167,151-175,28,026-030,"Below them was a low crypt with cases of formally arranged bones, some of them bearing terrible parallel inscriptions carved in Latin, Greek, and the tongue of Phrygia"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"Meanwhile, Dr"
174,151-175,27,026-030,"Trask had opened one of the prehistoric tumuli, and brought to light skulls which were slightly more human than a gorilla’s, and which bore indescribable ideographic carvings"
50,051-075,8,006-008,"Through all this horror my cat stalked unperturbed"
126,126-150,23,021-025,"Once I saw him monstrously perched atop a mountain of bones, and wondered at the secrets that might lie behind his yellow eyes"
255,251-275,40,036-040,"Having grasped to some slight degree the frightful revelations of this twilit area—an area so hideously foreshadowed by my recurrent dream—we turned to that apparently boundless depth of midnight cavern where no ray of light from the cliff could penetrate"
152,151-175,27,026-030,"We shall never know what sightless Stygian worlds yawn beyond the little distance we went, for it was decided that such secrets are not good for mankind"
409,more,73,more,"But there was plenty to engross us close at hand, for we had not gone far before the searchlights shewed that accursed infinity of pits in which the rats had feasted, and whose sudden lack of replenishment had driven the ravenous rodent army first to turn on the living herds of starving things, and then to burst forth from the priory in that historic orgy of devastation which the peasants will never forget"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"God"
65,076-010,11,011-015,"those carrion black pits of sawed, picked bones and opened skulls"
123,101-125,16,016-020,"Those nightmare chasms choked with the pithecanthropoid, Celtic, Roman, and English bones of countless unhallowed centuries"
68,076-010,15,011-015,"Some of them were full, and none can say how deep they had once been"
82,076-010,12,011-015,"Others were still bottomless to our searchlights, and peopled by unnamable fancies"
127,126-150,22,021-025,"What, I thought, of the hapless rats that stumbled into such traps amidst the blackness of their quests in this grisly Tartarus"
87,076-010,17,016-020,"Once my foot slipped near a horribly yawning brink, and I had a moment of ecstatic fear"
92,076-010,21,021-025,"I must have been musing a long time, for I could not see any of the party but the plump Capt"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Norrys"
208,201-225,39,036-040,"Then there came a sound from that inky, boundless, farther distance that I thought I knew; and I saw my old black cat dart past me like a winged Egyptian god, straight into the illimitable gulf of the unknown"
69,076-010,14,011-015,"But I was not far behind, for there was no doubt after another second"
275,251-275,44,041-045,"It was the eldritch scurrying of those fiend-born rats, always questing for new horrors, and determined to lead me on even unto those grinning caverns of earth’s centre where Nyarlathotep, the mad faceless god, howls blindly to the piping of two amorphous idiot flute-players"
39,026-050,7,006-008,"My searchlight expired, but still I ran"
248,226-250,42,041-045,"I heard voices, and yowls, and echoes, but above all there gently rose that impious, insidious scurrying; gently rising, rising, as a stiff bloated corpse gently rises above an oily river that flows under endless onyx bridges to a black, putrid sea"
49,051-075,7,006-008,"Something bumped into me—something soft and plump"
104,101-125,19,016-020,"It must have been the rats; the viscous, gelatinous, ravenous army that feast on the dead and the living"
73,076-010,16,016-020,"Why shouldn’t rats eat a de la Poer as a de la Poer eats forbidden things"
33,026-050,8,006-008,"The war ate my boy, damn them all"
80,076-010,14,011-015,"and the Yanks ate Carfax with flames and burnt Grandsire Delapore and the secret"
71,076-010,15,011-015,"No, no, I tell you, I am not that daemon swineherd in the twilit grotto"
64,076-010,12,011-015,"It was not Edward Norrys’ fat face on that flabby, fungous thing"
26,026-050,8,006-008,"Who says I am a de la Poer"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"He lived, but my boy died"
45,051-075,11,011-015,"Shall a Norrys hold the lands of a de la Poer"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"It’s voodoo, I tell you"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"that spotted snake"
65,076-010,13,011-015,"Curse you, Thornton, I’ll teach you to faint at what my family do"
49,051-075,9,009-010,"’Sblood, thou stinkard, I’ll learn ye how to gust"

56,051-075,11,011-015,"Norrys, with my own cat leaping and tearing at my throat"
171,151-175,30,026-030,"Now they have blown up Exham Priory, taken my Nigger-Man away from me, and shut me into this barred room at Hanwell with fearful whispers about my heredity and experiences"
69,076-010,14,011-015,"Thornton is in the next room, but they prevent me from talking to him"
73,076-010,13,011-015,"They are trying, too, to suppress most of the facts concerning the priory"
102,101-125,23,021-025,"When I speak of poor Norrys they accuse me of a hideous thing, but they must know that I did not do it"
286,more,54,051-055,"They must know it was the rats; the slithering, scurrying rats whose scampering will never let me sleep; the daemon rats that race behind the padding in this room and beckon me down to greater horrors than I have ever known; the rats they can never hear; the rats, the rats in the walls"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"STORY OF THE DOOR"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Mr"
204,201-225,34,031-035,"Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable"
289,more,52,051-055,"At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts of his life"
175,151-175,33,031-035,"He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years"
204,201-225,34,031-035,"But he had an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove"
103,101-125,22,021-025,"“I incline to Cain’s heresy,” he used to say quaintly: “I let my brother go to the devil in his own way"
146,126-150,26,026-030,"” In this character, it was frequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of downgoing men"
113,101-125,23,021-025,"And to such as these, so long as they came about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour"
32,026-050,8,006-008,"No doubt the feat was easy to Mr"
134,126-150,22,021-025,"Utterson; for he was undemonstrative at the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of good-nature"
132,126-150,25,021-025,"It is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was the lawyer’s way"
168,151-175,32,031-035,"His friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, they implied no aptness in the object"
46,051-075,10,009-010,"Hence, no doubt the bond that united him to Mr"
67,076-010,10,009-010,"Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman, the well-known man about town"
113,101-125,24,021-025,"It was a nut to crack for many, what these two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in common"
177,176-200,30,026-030,"It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend"
240,226-250,42,041-045,"For all that, the two men put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but even resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them uninterrupted"
103,101-125,21,021-025,"It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a by-street in a busy quarter of London"
92,076-010,18,016-020,"The street was small and what is called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays"
260,251-275,45,041-045,"The inhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to do better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen"
339,more,56,056-060,"Even on Sunday, when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger"
198,176-200,39,036-040,"Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was broken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street"
208,201-225,38,036-040,"It was two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower storey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore in every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence"
87,076-010,14,011-015,"The door, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered and distained"
266,251-275,47,046-050,"Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried his knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Mr"
146,126-150,28,026-030,"Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but when they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and pointed"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"“Did you ever remark that door"
129,126-150,25,021-025,"” he asked; and when his companion had replied in the affirmative, “It is connected in my mind,” added he, “with a very odd story"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"“Indeed"
9,011-025,3,003-005,"” said Mr"
59,051-075,11,011-015,"Utterson, with a slight change of voice, “and what was that"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
36,026-050,7,006-008,"“Well, it was this way,” returned Mr"
208,201-225,41,041-045,"Enfield: “I was coming home from some place at the end of the world, about three o’clock of a black winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps"
254,251-275,50,046-050,"Street after street and all the folks asleep—street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession and all as empty as a church—till at last I got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policeman"
199,176-200,43,041-045,"All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross street"
204,201-225,38,036-040,"Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man trampled calmly over the child’s body and left her screaming on the ground"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see"
56,051-075,11,011-015,"It wasn’t like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut"
149,126-150,28,026-030,"I gave a few halloa, took to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where there was already quite a group about the screaming child"
124,101-125,25,021-025,"He was perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running"
135,126-150,26,026-030,"The people who had turned out were the girl’s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for whom she had been sent put in his appearance"
139,126-150,26,026-030,"Well, the child was not much the worse, more frightened, according to the sawbones; and there you might have supposed would be an end to it"
38,026-050,6,006-008,"But there was one curious circumstance"
53,051-075,11,011-015,"I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight"
49,051-075,9,009-010,"So had the child’s family, which was only natural"
40,026-050,8,006-008,"But the doctor’s case was what struck me"
140,126-150,26,026-030,"He was the usual cut and dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe"
143,126-150,30,026-030,"Well, sir, he was like the rest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbones turn sick and white with the desire to kill him"
122,101-125,27,026-030,"I knew what was in his mind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the question, we did the next best"
132,126-150,29,026-030,"We told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end of London to the other"
74,076-010,15,011-015,"If he had any friends or any credit, we undertook that he should lose them"
136,126-150,30,026-030,"And all the time, as we were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we could for they were as wild as harpies"
196,176-200,36,036-040,"I never saw a circle of such hateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of black sneering coolness—frightened too, I could see that—but carrying it off, sir, really like Satan"
87,076-010,16,016-020,"‘If you choose to make capital out of this accident,’ said he, ‘I am naturally helpless"
50,051-075,10,009-010,"No gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene,’ says he"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"‘Name your figure"
198,176-200,39,036-040,"’ Well, we screwed him up to a hundred pounds for the child’s family; he would have clearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us that meant mischief, and at last he struck"
105,101-125,23,021-025,"The next thing was to get the money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with the door"
305,more,61,more,"—whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts’s, drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can’t mention, though it’s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least very well known and often printed"
90,076-010,18,016-020,"The figure was stiff; but the signature was good for more than that if it was only genuine"
250,226-250,48,046-050,"I took the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man’s cheque for close upon a hundred pounds"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"But he was quite easy and sneering"
102,101-125,21,021-025,"‘Set your mind at rest,’ says he, ‘I will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself"
198,176-200,41,041-045,"’ So we all set off, the doctor, and the child’s father, and our friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank"
84,076-010,18,016-020,"I gave in the cheque myself, and said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery"
15,011-025,5,003-005,"Not a bit of it"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"The cheque was genuine"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"“Tut-tut"
9,011-025,3,003-005,"” said Mr"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Utterson"
33,026-050,9,009-010,"“I see you feel as I do,” said Mr"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"Enfield"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"“Yes, it’s a bad story"
243,226-250,48,046-050,"For my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really damnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of the proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your fellows who do what they call good"
95,076-010,18,016-020,"Blackmail, I suppose; an honest man paying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth"
71,076-010,14,011-015,"Black Mail House is what I call the place with the door, in consequence"
112,101-125,22,021-025,"Though even that, you know, is far from explaining all,” he added, and with the words fell into a vein of musing"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"From this he was recalled by Mr"
92,076-010,16,016-020,"Utterson asking rather suddenly: “And you don’t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"“A likely place, isn’t it"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"” returned Mr"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"Enfield"
75,076-010,15,011-015,"“But I happen to have noticed his address; he lives in some square or other"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
50,051-075,9,009-010,"“And you never asked about the—place with the door"
9,011-025,3,003-005,"” said Mr"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Utterson"
42,051-075,9,009-010,"“No, sir; I had a delicacy,” was the reply"
103,101-125,19,016-020,"“I feel very strongly about putting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"You start a question, and it’s like starting a stone"
237,226-250,47,046-050,"You sit quietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others; and presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of) is knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to change their name"
85,076-010,20,016-020,"No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks like Queer Street, the less I ask"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
40,026-050,8,006-008,"“A very good rule, too,” said the lawyer"
55,051-075,10,009-010,"“But I have studied the place for myself,” continued Mr"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"Enfield"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"“It seems scarcely a house"
119,101-125,25,021-025,"There is no other door, and nobody goes in or out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my adventure"
122,101-125,22,021-025,"There are three windows looking on the court on the first floor; none below; the windows are always shut but they’re clean"
83,076-010,15,011-015,"And then there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must live there"
139,126-150,27,026-030,"And yet it’s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed together about the court, that it’s hard to say where one ends and another begins"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
76,076-010,15,011-015,"The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then “Enfield,” said Mr"
38,026-050,7,006-008,"Utterson, “that’s a good rule of yours"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
38,026-050,7,006-008,"“Yes, I think it is,” returned Enfield"
74,076-010,14,011-015,"“But for all that,” continued the lawyer, “there’s one point I want to ask"
60,051-075,14,011-015,"I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"“Well,” said Mr"
43,051-075,9,009-010,"Enfield, “I can’t see what harm it would do"
32,026-050,9,009-010,"It was a man of the name of Hyde"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"“Hm,” said Mr"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Utterson"
32,026-050,9,009-010,"“What sort of a man is he to see"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"“He is not easy to describe"
100,076-010,12,011-015,"There is something wrong with his appearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable"
58,051-075,14,011-015,"I never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why"
108,101-125,18,016-020,"He must be deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I couldn’t specify the point"
83,076-010,16,016-020,"He’s an extraordinary looking man, and yet I really can name nothing out of the way"
55,051-075,13,011-015,"No, sir; I can make no hand of it; I can’t describe him"
68,076-010,15,011-015,"And it’s not want of memory; for I declare I can see him this moment"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Mr"
87,076-010,14,011-015,"Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a weight of consideration"
27,026-050,7,006-008,"“You are sure he used a key"
21,011-025,5,003-005,"” he inquired at last"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"“My dear sir"
41,051-075,7,006-008,"” began Enfield, surprised out of himself"
58,051-075,11,011-015,"“Yes, I know,” said Utterson; “I know it must seem strange"
93,076-010,22,021-025,"The fact is, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I know it already"
41,051-075,8,006-008,"You see, Richard, your tale has gone home"
63,076-010,13,011-015,"If you have been inexact in any point you had better correct it"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
81,076-010,15,011-015,"“I think you might have warned me,” returned the other with a touch of sullenness"
51,051-075,10,009-010,"“But I have been pedantically exact, as you call it"
54,051-075,12,011-015,"The fellow had a key; and what’s more, he has it still"
31,026-050,9,009-010,"I saw him use it not a week ago"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Mr"
81,076-010,14,011-015,"Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man presently resumed"
48,051-075,9,009-010,"“Here is another lesson to say nothing,” said he"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"“I am ashamed of my long tongue"
50,051-075,11,011-015,"Let us make a bargain never to refer to this again"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
36,026-050,7,006-008,"“With all my heart,” said the lawyer"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"“I shake hands on that, Richard"

96,076-010,17,016-020,"Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre spirits and sat down to dinner without relish"
251,251-275,50,046-050,"It was his custom of a Sunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of some dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go soberly and gratefully to bed"

82,076-010,15,011-015,"Hyde that had swelled his indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge"
86,076-010,19,016-020,"It was already bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn no more"
212,201-225,37,036-040,"It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable attributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so long baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment of a fiend"
124,101-125,25,021-025,"“I thought it was madness,” he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper in the safe, “and now I begin to fear it is disgrace"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
162,151-175,30,026-030,"With that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in the direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his friend, the great Dr"
56,051-075,9,009-010,"Lanyon, had his house and received his crowding patients"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"“If anyone knows, it will be Lanyon,” he had thought"
140,126-150,26,026-030,"The solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage of delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where Dr"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"Lanyon sat alone over his wine"
132,126-150,21,021-025,"This was a hearty, healthy, dapper, red-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a boisterous and decided manner"
14,011-025,4,003-005,"At sight of Mr"
70,076-010,13,011-015,"Utterson, he sprang up from his chair and welcomed him with both hands"
111,101-125,21,021-025,"The geniality, as was the way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed on genuine feeling"
208,201-225,35,031-035,"For these two were old friends, old mates both at school and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of each other, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each other’s company"
105,101-125,18,016-020,"After a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so disagreeably preoccupied his mind"
93,076-010,18,016-020,"“I suppose, Lanyon,” said he, “you and I must be the two oldest friends that Henry Jekyll has"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
46,051-075,8,006-008,"“I wish the friends were younger,” chuckled Dr"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Lanyon"
21,011-025,5,003-005,"“But I suppose we are"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"And what of that"
23,026-050,6,006-008,"I see little of him now"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
7,000-010,1,000-002,"“Indeed"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"” said Utterson"
44,051-075,9,009-010,"“I thought you had a bond of common interest"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"“We had,” was the reply"
76,076-010,15,011-015,"“But it is more than ten years since Henry Jekyll became too fanciful for me"
178,176-200,38,036-040,"He began to go wrong, wrong in mind; and though of course I continue to take an interest in him for old sake’s sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the man"
114,101-125,15,011-015,"Such unscientific balderdash,” added the doctor, flushing suddenly purple, “would have estranged Damon and Pythias"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
59,051-075,12,011-015,"This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Utterson"
191,176-200,34,031-035,"“They have only differed on some point of science,” he thought; and being a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of conveyancing), he even added: “It is nothing worse than that"
112,101-125,22,021-025,"” He gave his friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached the question he had come to put"
51,051-075,10,009-010,"“Did you ever come across a protégé of his—one Hyde"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"” he asked"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"“Hyde"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"” repeated Lanyon"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"“No"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"Never heard of him"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"Since my time"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
183,176-200,36,036-040,"That was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with him to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until the small hours of the morning began to grow large"
101,101-125,19,016-020,"It was a night of little ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and besieged by questions"
81,076-010,16,016-020,"Six o’clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently near to Mr"
60,051-075,10,009-010,"Utterson’s dwelling, and still he was digging at the problem"
208,201-225,38,036-040,"Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone; but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room, Mr"
70,076-010,13,011-015,"Enfield’s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures"
260,251-275,50,046-050,"He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child running from the doctor’s; and then these met, and that human Juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams"
225,201-225,44,041-045,"Or else he would see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay asleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that room would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the sleeper recalled, and lo"
123,101-125,26,026-030,"there would stand by his side a figure to whom power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and do its bidding"
345,more,62,more,"The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all night; and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glide more stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and still the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of lamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave her screaming"
311,more,61,more,"And still the figure had no face by which he might know it; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and melted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyer’s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate, curiosity to behold the features of the real Mr"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"Hyde"
165,151-175,30,026-030,"If he could but once set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well examined"
141,126-150,26,026-030,"He might see a reason for his friend’s strange preference or bondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of the will"
214,201-225,43,041-045,"At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to raise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of enduring hatred"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"From that time forward, Mr"
58,051-075,11,011-015,"Utterson began to haunt the door in the by-street of shops"
237,226-250,46,046-050,"In the morning before office hours, at noon when business was plenty and time scarce, at night under the face of the fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or concourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post"
12,011-025,4,003-005,"“If he be Mr"
37,026-050,8,006-008,"Hyde,” he had thought, “I shall be Mr"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"Seek"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
37,026-050,7,006-008,"And at last his patience was rewarded"
163,151-175,32,031-035,"It was a fine dry night; frost in the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps, unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow"
144,126-150,27,026-030,"By ten o’clock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very solitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very silent"
187,176-200,34,031-035,"Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Mr"
99,076-010,19,016-020,"Utterson had been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light footstep drawing near"
238,226-250,45,041-045,"In the course of his nightly patrols, he had long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city"
181,176-200,31,031-035,"Yet his attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry of the court"
99,076-010,18,016-020,"The steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they turned the end of the street"
95,076-010,19,016-020,"The lawyer, looking forth from the entry, could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with"
137,126-150,23,021-025,"He was small and very plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went somehow strongly against the watcher’s inclination"
141,126-150,28,026-030,"But he made straight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he came, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Mr"
65,076-010,12,011-015,"Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"“Mr"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"Hyde, I think"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Mr"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath"
127,126-150,25,021-025,"But his fear was only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face, he answered coolly enough: “That is my name"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"What do you want"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
45,051-075,9,009-010,"“I see you are going in,” returned the lawyer"
25,026-050,7,006-008,"“I am an old friend of Dr"
11,011-025,1,000-002,"Jekyll’s—Mr"
118,101-125,21,021-025,"Utterson of Gaunt Street—you must have heard of my name; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
21,011-025,5,003-005,"“You will not find Dr"
36,026-050,7,006-008,"Jekyll; he is from home,” replied Mr"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"Hyde, blowing in the key"
69,076-010,13,011-015,"And then suddenly, but still without looking up, “How did you know me"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"” he asked"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"“On your side,” said Mr"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"Utterson “will you do me a favour"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
34,026-050,5,003-005,"“With pleasure,” replied the other"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"“What shall it be"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
30,026-050,7,006-008,"“Will you let me see your face"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"” asked the lawyer"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Mr"
177,176-200,32,031-035,"Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden reflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds"
37,026-050,8,006-008,"“Now I shall know you again,” said Mr"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Utterson"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"“It may be useful"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"“Yes,” returned Mr"
74,076-010,16,016-020,"Hyde, “It is as well we have met; and à propos, you should have my address"
42,051-075,11,011-015,"” And he gave a number of a street in Soho"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"“Good God"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"” thought Mr"
54,051-075,10,009-010,"Utterson, “can he, too, have been thinking of the will"
87,076-010,16,016-020,"” But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in acknowledgment of the address"
47,051-075,10,009-010,"“And now,” said the other, “how did you know me"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
31,026-050,5,003-005,"“By description,” was the reply"
18,011-025,2,000-002,"“Whose description"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
33,026-050,6,006-008,"“We have common friends,” said Mr"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Utterson"
27,026-050,4,003-005,"“Common friends,” echoed Mr"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"Hyde, a little hoarsely"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"“Who are they"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
39,026-050,6,006-008,"“Jekyll, for instance,” said the lawyer"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"“He never told you,” cried Mr"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"Hyde, with a flush of anger"
36,026-050,8,006-008,"“I did not think you would have lied"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"“Come,” said Mr"
39,026-050,6,006-008,"Utterson, “that is not fitting language"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
151,151-175,25,021-025,"The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with extraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into the house"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"The lawyer stood awhile when Mr"
45,051-075,8,006-008,"Hyde had left him, the picture of disquietude"
132,126-150,26,026-030,"Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental perplexity"
87,076-010,18,016-020,"The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of a class that is rarely solved"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Mr"
425,more,72,more,"Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an impression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a displeasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky, whispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against him, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust, loathing and fear with which Mr"
21,011-025,3,003-005,"Utterson regarded him"
60,051-075,9,009-010,"“There must be something else,” said the perplexed gentleman"
55,051-075,12,011-015,"“There is something more, if I could find a name for it"
40,026-050,8,006-008,"God bless me, the man seems hardly human"
35,026-050,5,003-005,"Something troglodytic, shall we say"
32,026-050,9,009-010,"or can it be the old story of Dr"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"Fell"
108,101-125,19,016-020,"or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul that thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent"
130,126-150,28,026-030,"The last, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan’s signature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
282,more,47,046-050,"Round the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient, handsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men; map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure enterprises"
207,201-225,38,036-040,"One house, however, second from the corner, was still occupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of wealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for the fanlight, Mr"
28,026-050,4,003-005,"Utterson stopped and knocked"
47,051-075,7,006-008,"A well-dressed, elderly servant opened the door"
6,000-010,2,000-002,"“Is Dr"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"Jekyll at home, Poole"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"” asked the lawyer"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"“I will see, Mr"
231,226-250,38,036-040,"Utterson,” said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he spoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags, warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire, and furnished with costly cabinets of oak"
36,026-050,8,006-008,"“Will you wait here by the fire, sir"
46,051-075,10,009-010,"or shall I give you a light in the dining-room"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
82,076-010,16,016-020,"“Here, thank you,” said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the tall fender"
165,151-175,33,031-035,"This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy of his friend the doctor’s; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of it as the pleasantest room in London"
321,more,64,more,"But tonight there was a shudder in his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of his spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the shadow on the roof"
79,076-010,14,011-015,"He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presently returned to announce that Dr"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"Jekyll was gone out"
9,011-025,3,003-005,"“I saw Mr"
54,051-075,11,011-015,"Hyde go in by the old dissecting room, Poole,” he said"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"“Is that right, when Dr"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"Jekyll is from home"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"“Quite right, Mr"
35,026-050,5,003-005,"Utterson, sir,” replied the servant"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"“Mr"
14,011-025,4,003-005,"Hyde has a key"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
104,101-125,19,016-020,"“Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man, Poole,” resumed the other musingly"
38,026-050,7,006-008,"“Yes, sir, he does indeed,” said Poole"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"“We have all orders to obey him"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
29,026-050,8,006-008,"“I do not think I ever met Mr"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"Hyde"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"” asked Utterson"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"“O, dear no, sir"
40,026-050,7,006-008,"He never dines here,” replied the butler"
103,101-125,21,021-025,"“Indeed we see very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes and goes by the laboratory"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
24,026-050,3,003-005,"“Well, good-night, Poole"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
15,011-025,2,000-002,"“Good-night, Mr"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Utterson"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
55,051-075,11,011-015,"And the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart"
74,076-010,14,011-015,"“Poor Harry Jekyll,” he thought, “my mind misgives me he is in deep waters"
117,101-125,26,026-030,"He was wild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of God, there is no statute of limitations"
184,176-200,31,031-035,"Ay, it must be that; the ghost of some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment coming, pede claudo, years after memory has forgotten and self-love condoned the fault"
193,176-200,35,031-035,"” And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded awhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, least by chance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light there"
272,251-275,54,051-055,"His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of their life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and fearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided"
72,076-010,15,011-015,"And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of hope"
186,176-200,33,031-035,"“This Master Hyde, if he were studied,” thought he, “must have secrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared to which poor Jekyll’s worst would be like sunshine"
34,026-050,6,006-008,"Things cannot continue as they are"
112,101-125,21,021-025,"It turns me cold to think of this creature stealing like a thief to Harry’s bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening"
107,101-125,21,021-025,"And the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the will, he may grow impatient to inherit"
106,101-125,22,021-025,"Ay, I must put my shoulders to the wheel—if Jekyll will but let me,” he added, “if Jekyll will only let me"
103,101-125,20,016-020,"” For once more he saw before his mind’s eye, as clear as transparency, the strange clauses of the will"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"DR"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE"
189,176-200,34,031-035,"A fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent, reputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr"
75,076-010,12,011-015,"Utterson so contrived that he remained behind after the others had departed"
79,076-010,15,011-015,"This was no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of times"
43,051-075,8,006-008,"Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well"
284,more,47,046-050,"Hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had already their foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his unobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in the man’s rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"To this rule, Dr"
256,251-275,46,046-050,"Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite side of the fire—a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with something of a stylish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and kindness—you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr"
37,026-050,6,006-008,"Utterson a sincere and warm affection"
63,076-010,12,011-015,"“I have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,” began the latter"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"“You know that will of yours"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
104,101-125,18,016-020,"A close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful; but the doctor carried it off gaily"
66,076-010,12,011-015,"“My poor Utterson,” said he, “you are unfortunate in such a client"
143,126-150,27,026-030,"I never saw a man so distressed as you were by my will; unless it were that hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at what he called my scientific heresies"
171,151-175,31,031-035,"O, I know he’s a good fellow—you needn’t frown—an excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more of him; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"I was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
92,076-010,14,011-015,"“You know I never approved of it,” pursued Utterson, ruthlessly disregarding the fresh topic"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"“My will"
63,076-010,11,011-015,"Yes, certainly, I know that,” said the doctor, a trifle sharply"
20,011-025,5,003-005,"“You have told me so"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
49,051-075,9,009-010,"“Well, I tell you so again,” continued the lawyer"
45,051-075,8,006-008,"“I have been learning something of young Hyde"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"The large handsome face of Dr"
76,076-010,15,011-015,"Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about his eyes"
37,026-050,9,009-010,"“I do not care to hear more,” said he"
49,051-075,11,011-015,"“This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
44,051-075,7,006-008,"“What I heard was abominable,” said Utterson"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"“It can make no change"
93,076-010,15,011-015,"You do not understand my position,” returned the doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner"
84,076-010,14,011-015,"“I am painfully situated, Utterson; my position is a very strange—a very strange one"
59,051-075,12,011-015,"It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
63,076-010,13,011-015,"“Jekyll,” said Utterson, “you know me: I am a man to be trusted"
86,076-010,20,016-020,"Make a clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you out of it"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
134,126-150,27,026-030,"“My good Utterson,” said the doctor, “this is very good of you, this is downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in"
277,more,60,056-060,"I believe you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn’t what you fancy; it is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I will tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"Hyde"
208,201-225,45,041-045,"I give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I will just add one little word, Utterson, that I’m sure you’ll take in good part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
48,051-075,8,006-008,"Utterson reflected a little, looking in the fire"
79,076-010,16,016-020,"“I have no doubt you are perfectly right,” he said at last, getting to his feet"
157,151-175,29,026-030,"“Well, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the last time I hope,” continued the doctor, “there is one point I should like you to understand"
48,051-075,10,009-010,"I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde"
63,076-010,16,016-020,"I know you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude"
187,176-200,40,036-040,"But I do sincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and if I am taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bear with him and get his rights for him"
93,076-010,21,021-025,"I think you would, if you knew all; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
61,051-075,12,011-015,"“I can’t pretend that I shall ever like him,” said the lawyer"
163,151-175,34,031-035,"“I don’t ask that,” pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the other’s arm; “I only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake, when I am no longer here"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
37,026-050,5,003-005,"Utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh"
27,026-050,5,003-005,"“Well,” said he, “I promise"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"THE CAREW MURDER CASE"
171,151-175,32,031-035,"Nearly a year later, in the month of October, 18—, London was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim"
34,026-050,6,006-008,"The details were few and startling"
100,076-010,20,016-020,"A maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone upstairs to bed about eleven"
185,176-200,34,031-035,"Although a fog rolled over the city in the small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the lane, which the maid’s window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the full moon"
141,126-150,26,026-030,"It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon her box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a dream of musing"
163,151-175,30,026-030,"Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she narrated that experience), never had she felt more at peace with all men or thought more kindly of the world"
213,201-225,39,036-040,"And as she so sat she became aware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near along the lane; and advancing to meet him, another and very small gentleman, to whom at first she paid less attention"
154,151-175,28,026-030,"When they had come within speech (which was just under the maid’s eyes) the older man bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness"
383,more,70,more,"It did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great importance; indeed, from his pointing, it sometimes appeared as if he were only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he spoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such an innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something high too, as of a well-founded self-content"
95,076-010,18,016-020,"Presently her eye wandered to the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain Mr"
78,076-010,15,011-015,"Hyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a dislike"
144,126-150,27,026-030,"He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which he was trifling; but he answered never a word, and seemed to listen with an ill-contained impatience"
167,151-175,33,031-035,"And then all of a sudden he broke out in a great flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, and carrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman"
109,101-125,23,021-025,"The old gentleman took a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle hurt; and at that Mr"
57,051-075,12,011-015,"Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to the earth"
192,176-200,34,031-035,"And next moment, with ape-like fury, he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway"
58,051-075,11,011-015,"At the horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted"
69,076-010,14,011-015,"It was two o’clock when she came to herself and called for the police"
102,101-125,19,016-020,"The murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle of the lane, incredibly mangled"
299,more,53,051-055,"The stick with which the deed had been done, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter—the other, without doubt, had been carried away by the murderer"
203,201-225,39,036-040,"A purse and gold watch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a sealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the post, and which bore the name and address of Mr"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Utterson"
166,151-175,34,031-035,"This was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of bed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, than he shot out a solemn lip"
83,076-010,17,016-020,"“I shall say nothing till I have seen the body,” said he; “this may be very serious"
39,026-050,8,006-008,"Have the kindness to wait while I dress"
137,126-150,24,021-025,"” And with the same grave countenance he hurried through his breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had been carried"
43,051-075,10,009-010,"As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"“Yes,” said he, “I recognise him"
48,051-075,11,011-015,"I am sorry to say that this is Sir Danvers Carew"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
55,051-075,9,009-010,"“Good God, sir,” exclaimed the officer, “is it possible"
67,076-010,12,011-015,"” And the next moment his eye lighted up with professional ambition"
41,051-075,9,009-010,"“This will make a deal of noise,” he said"
39,026-050,9,009-010,"“And perhaps you can help us to the man"
77,076-010,15,011-015,"” And he briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken stick"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Mr"
235,226-250,44,041-045,"Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the stick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and battered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself presented many years before to Henry Jekyll"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"“Is this Mr"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"Hyde a person of small stature"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"” he inquired"
98,076-010,14,011-015,"“Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid calls him,” said the officer"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Mr"
131,126-150,27,026-030,"Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, “If you will come with me in my cab,” he said, “I think I can take you to his house"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
78,076-010,17,016-020,"It was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the season"
180,176-200,29,026-030,"A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so that as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr"
354,more,65,more,"Utterson beheld a marvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be dark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich, lurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here, for a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths"
308,more,51,051-055,"The dismal quarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy ways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful reinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer’s eyes, like a district of some city in a nightmare"
235,226-250,45,041-045,"The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of the gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive, he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law’s officers, which may at times assail the most honest"
481,more,87,more,"As the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a little and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating house, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many ragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of many different nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning glass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part, as brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings"
103,101-125,21,021-025,"This was the home of Henry Jekyll’s favourite; of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling"
59,051-075,9,009-010,"An ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door"
75,076-010,13,011-015,"She had an evil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but her manners were excellent"
26,026-050,6,006-008,"Yes, she said, this was Mr"
286,more,56,056-060,"Hyde’s, but he was not at home; he had been in that night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour; there was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and he was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she had seen him till yesterday"
169,151-175,33,031-035,"“Very well, then, we wish to see his rooms,” said the lawyer; and when the woman began to declare it was impossible, “I had better tell you who this person is,” he added"
44,051-075,7,006-008,"“This is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland Yard"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"A flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman’s face"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"“Ah"
29,026-050,7,006-008,"” said she, “he is in trouble"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"What has he done"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Mr"
44,051-075,6,006-008,"Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances"
61,051-075,10,009-010,"“He don’t seem a very popular character,” observed the latter"
76,076-010,16,016-020,"“And now, my good woman, just let me and this gentleman have a look about us"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
90,076-010,17,016-020,"In the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained otherwise empty, Mr"
89,076-010,17,016-020,"Hyde had only used a couple of rooms; but these were furnished with luxury and good taste"
250,226-250,46,046-050,"A closet was filled with wine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung upon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who was much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and agreeable in colour"
277,more,48,046-050,"At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark of having been recently and hurriedly ransacked; clothes lay about the floor, with their pockets inside out; lock-fast drawers stood open; and on the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had been burned"
254,251-275,44,041-045,"From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end of a green cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the other half of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinched his suspicions, the officer declared himself delighted"
127,126-150,21,021-025,"A visit to the bank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the murderer’s credit, completed his gratification"
41,051-075,9,009-010,"“You may depend upon it, sir,” he told Mr"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"Utterson: “I have him in my hand"
103,101-125,21,021-025,"He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the stick or, above all, burned the cheque book"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"Why, money’s life to the man"
77,076-010,17,016-020,"We have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out the handbills"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
61,051-075,11,011-015,"This last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr"
237,226-250,40,036-040,"Hyde had numbered few familiars—even the master of the servant maid had only seen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never been photographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, as common observers will"
140,126-150,23,021-025,"Only on one point were they agreed; and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive impressed his beholders"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"INCIDENT OF THE LETTER"
37,026-050,8,006-008,"It was late in the afternoon, when Mr"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"Utterson found his way to Dr"
226,226-250,40,036-040,"Jekyll’s door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden, to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or dissecting rooms"
198,176-200,35,031-035,"The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than anatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of the garden"
459,more,77,more,"It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in that part of his friend’s quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless structure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical apparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola"
101,101-125,20,016-020,"At the further end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize; and through this, Mr"
55,051-075,9,009-010,"Utterson was at last received into the doctor’s cabinet"
196,176-200,34,031-035,"It was a large room fitted round with glass presses, furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron"
169,151-175,35,031-035,"The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr"
28,026-050,4,003-005,"Jekyll, looking deathly sick"
101,101-125,22,021-025,"He did not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a changed voice"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"“And now,” said Mr"
66,076-010,13,011-015,"Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, “you have heard the news"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
20,011-025,3,003-005,"The doctor shuddered"
44,051-075,9,009-010,"“They were crying it in the square,” he said"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"“I heard them in my dining-room"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
27,026-050,5,003-005,"“One word,” said the lawyer"
72,076-010,17,016-020,"“Carew was my client, but so are you, and I want to know what I am doing"
48,051-075,10,009-010,"You have not been mad enough to hide this fellow"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
96,076-010,20,016-020,"“Utterson, I swear to God,” cried the doctor, “I swear to God I will never set eyes on him again"
61,051-075,15,011-015,"I bind my honour to you that I am done with him in this world"
19,011-025,6,006-008,"It is all at an end"
141,126-150,33,031-035,"And indeed he does not want my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite safe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
74,076-010,12,011-015,"The lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend’s feverish manner"
83,076-010,18,016-020,"“You seem pretty sure of him,” said he; “and for your sake, I hope you may be right"
45,051-075,10,009-010,"If it came to a trial, your name might appear"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
104,101-125,20,016-020,"“I am quite sure of him,” replied Jekyll; “I have grounds for certainty that I cannot share with any one"
49,051-075,11,011-015,"But there is one thing on which you may advise me"
90,076-010,20,016-020,"I have—I have received a letter; and I am at a loss whether I should show it to the police"
116,101-125,25,021-025,"I should like to leave it in your hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have so great a trust in you"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
57,051-075,11,011-015,"“You fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"” asked the lawyer"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"“No,” said the other"
72,076-010,16,016-020,"“I cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I am quite done with him"
82,076-010,14,011-015,"I was thinking of my own character, which this hateful business has rather exposed"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
95,076-010,15,011-015,"Utterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend’s selfishness, and yet relieved by it"
48,051-075,10,009-010,"“Well,” said he, at last, “let me see the letter"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
139,126-150,23,021-025,"The letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed “Edward Hyde”: and it signified, briefly enough, that the writer’s benefactor, Dr"
180,176-200,33,031-035,"Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand generosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had means of escape on which he placed a sure dependence"
158,151-175,30,026-030,"The lawyer liked this letter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he had looked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"“Have you the envelope"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"” he asked"
65,076-010,12,011-015,"“I burned it,” replied Jekyll, “before I thought what I was about"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"But it bore no postmark"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"The note was handed in"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
36,026-050,8,006-008,"“Shall I keep this and sleep upon it"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"” asked Utterson"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"“I wish you to judge for me entirely,” was the reply"
33,026-050,6,006-008,"“I have lost confidence in myself"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
45,051-075,7,006-008,"“Well, I shall consider,” returned the lawyer"
96,076-010,18,016-020,"“And now one word more: it was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that disappearance"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
86,076-010,16,016-020,"The doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; he shut his mouth tight and nodded"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"“I knew it,” said Utterson"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"“He meant to murder you"
21,011-025,5,003-005,"You had a fine escape"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
138,126-150,27,026-030,"“I have had what is far more to the purpose,” returned the doctor solemnly: “I have had a lesson—O God, Utterson, what a lesson I have had"
53,051-075,12,011-015,"” And he covered his face for a moment with his hands"
67,076-010,15,011-015,"On his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole"
88,076-010,17,016-020,"“By the bye,” said he, “there was a letter handed in to-day: what was the messenger like"
96,076-010,18,016-020,"” But Poole was positive nothing had come except by post; “and only circulars by that,” he added"
53,051-075,10,009-010,"This news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed"
191,176-200,34,031-035,"Plainly the letter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been written in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently judged, and handled with the more caution"
92,076-010,14,011-015,"The newsboys, as he went, were crying themselves hoarse along the footways: “Special edition"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"Shocking murder of an M"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"P"
180,176-200,35,031-035,"” That was the funeral oration of one friend and client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal"
136,126-150,27,026-030,"It was, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and self-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for advice"
78,076-010,16,016-020,"It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it might be fished for"
62,076-010,13,011-015,"Presently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr"
200,176-200,36,036-040,"Guest, his head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely calculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house"
272,251-275,49,046-050,"The fog still slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps glimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of these fallen clouds, the procession of the town’s life was still rolling in through the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind"
35,026-050,7,006-008,"But the room was gay with firelight"
256,251-275,47,046-050,"In the bottle the acids were long ago resolved; the imperial dye had softened with time, as the colour grows richer in stained windows; and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on hillside vineyards, was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs of London"
28,026-050,4,003-005,"Insensibly the lawyer melted"
56,051-075,12,011-015,"There was no man from whom he kept fewer secrets than Mr"
66,076-010,15,011-015,"Guest; and he was not always sure that he kept as many as he meant"
106,101-125,21,021-025,"Guest had often been on business to the doctor’s; he knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr"
148,126-150,27,026-030,"Hyde’s familiarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it not as well, then, that he should see a letter which put that mystery to right"
120,101-125,20,016-020,"and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic of handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging"
133,126-150,25,021-025,"The clerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange a document without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr"
38,026-050,6,006-008,"Utterson might shape his future course"
51,051-075,10,009-010,"“This is a sad business about Sir Danvers,” he said"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"“Yes, sir, indeed"
63,076-010,11,011-015,"It has elicited a great deal of public feeling,” returned Guest"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"“The man, of course, was mad"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
60,051-075,11,011-015,"“I should like to hear your views on that,” replied Utterson"
142,126-150,29,026-030,"“I have a document here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves, for I scarce know what to do about it; it is an ugly business at the best"
58,051-075,11,011-015,"But there it is; quite in your way: a murderer’s autograph"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
76,076-010,14,011-015,"Guest’s eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it with passion"
50,051-075,12,011-015,"“No sir,” he said: “not mad; but it is an odd hand"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
57,051-075,11,011-015,"“And by all accounts a very odd writer,” added the lawyer"
41,051-075,8,006-008,"Just then the servant entered with a note"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"“Is that from Dr"
11,011-025,2,000-002,"Jekyll, sir"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"” inquired the clerk"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"“I thought I knew the writing"
20,011-025,3,003-005,"Anything private, Mr"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Utterson"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
29,026-050,5,003-005,"“Only an invitation to dinner"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"Why"
21,011-025,6,006-008,"Do you want to see it"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
11,011-025,2,000-002,"“One moment"
110,101-125,19,016-020,"I thank you, sir;” and the clerk laid the two sheets of paper alongside and sedulously compared their contents"
85,076-010,14,011-015,"“Thank you, sir,” he said at last, returning both; “it’s a very interesting autograph"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"There was a pause, during which Mr"
31,026-050,4,003-005,"Utterson struggled with himself"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"“Why did you compare them, Guest"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"” he inquired suddenly"
140,126-150,21,021-025,"“Well, sir,” returned the clerk, “there’s a rather singular resemblance; the two hands are in many points identical: only differently sloped"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
30,026-050,4,003-005,"“Rather quaint,” said Utterson"
50,051-075,9,009-010,"“It is, as you say, rather quaint,” returned Guest"
58,051-075,11,011-015,"“I wouldn’t speak of this note, you know,” said the master"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"“No, sir,” said the clerk"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"“I understand"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
20,011-025,5,003-005,"But no sooner was Mr"
105,101-125,19,016-020,"Utterson alone that night, than he locked the note into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"“What"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"” he thought"
34,026-050,6,006-008,"“Henry Jekyll forge for a murderer"
37,026-050,9,009-010,"” And his blood ran cold in his veins"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"INCIDENT OF DR"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"LANYON"
125,101-125,24,021-025,"Time ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the death of Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr"
80,076-010,16,016-020,"Hyde had disappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never existed"
278,more,49,046-050,"Much of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable: tales came out of the man’s cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of his vile life, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to have surrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a whisper"
135,126-150,28,026-030,"From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of the murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on, Mr"
95,076-010,18,016-020,"Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to grow more at quiet with himself"
99,076-010,20,016-020,"The death of Sir Danvers was, to his way of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"Hyde"
72,076-010,14,011-015,"Now that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for Dr"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Jekyll"
217,201-225,36,036-040,"He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his friends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; and whilst he had always been known for charities, he was now no less distinguished for religion"
193,176-200,39,036-040,"He was busy, he was much in the open air, he did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inward consciousness of service; and for more than two months, the doctor was at peace"
215,201-225,43,041-045,"On the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor’s with a small party; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had looked from one to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable friends"
72,076-010,15,011-015,"On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against the lawyer"
67,076-010,13,011-015,"“The doctor was confined to the house,” Poole said, “and saw no one"
193,176-200,38,036-040,"” On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; and having now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost daily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits"
87,076-010,19,016-020,"The fifth night he had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook himself to Dr"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Lanyon’s"
143,126-150,27,026-030,"There at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor’s appearance"
54,051-075,9,009-010,"He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face"
294,more,57,056-060,"The rosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly balder and older; and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift physical decay that arrested the lawyer’s notice, as a look in the eye and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror of the mind"
104,101-125,19,016-020,"It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet that was what Utterson was tempted to suspect"
136,126-150,28,026-030,"“Yes,” he thought; “he is a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted; and the knowledge is more than he can bear"
129,126-150,25,021-025,"” And yet when Utterson remarked on his ill looks, it was with an air of great firmness that Lanyon declared himself a doomed man"
57,051-075,12,011-015,"“I have had a shock,” he said, “and I shall never recover"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"It is a question of weeks"
69,076-010,15,011-015,"Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir, I used to like it"
68,076-010,15,011-015,"I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more glad to get away"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
39,026-050,6,006-008,"“Jekyll is ill, too,” observed Utterson"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"“Have you seen him"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
58,051-075,11,011-015,"But Lanyon’s face changed, and he held up a trembling hand"
36,026-050,10,009-010,"“I wish to see or hear no more of Dr"
42,051-075,8,006-008,"Jekyll,” he said in a loud, unsteady voice"
109,101-125,24,021-025,"“I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any allusion to one whom I regard as dead"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"“Tut, tut"
9,011-025,3,003-005,"” said Mr"
67,076-010,11,011-015,"Utterson; and then after a considerable pause, “Can’t I do anything"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"” he inquired"
72,076-010,14,011-015,"“We are three very old friends, Lanyon; we shall not live to make others"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
52,051-075,8,006-008,"“Nothing can be done,” returned Lanyon; “ask himself"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
37,026-050,8,006-008,"“He will not see me,” said the lawyer"
43,051-075,9,009-010,"“I am not surprised at that,” was the reply"
95,076-010,19,016-020,"“Some day, Utterson, after I am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"I cannot tell you"
199,176-200,42,041-045,"And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me of other things, for God’s sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep clear of this accursed topic, then in God’s name, go, for I cannot bear it"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
280,more,49,046-050,"As soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll, complaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of this unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long answer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious in drift"
37,026-050,6,006-008,"The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable"
92,076-010,19,016-020,"“I do not blame our old friend,” Jekyll wrote, “but I share his view that we must never meet"
157,151-175,31,031-035,"I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you must not be surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is often shut even to you"
40,026-050,10,009-010,"You must suffer me to go my own dark way"
69,076-010,14,011-015,"I have brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name"
62,076-010,14,011-015,"If I am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also"
191,176-200,35,031-035,"I could not think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors so unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this destiny, and that is to respect my silence"
310,more,58,056-060,"” Utterson was amazed; the dark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to his old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with every promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment, friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life were wrecked"
135,126-150,25,021-025,"So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness; but in view of Lanyon’s manner and words, there must lie for it some deeper ground"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"A week afterwards Dr"
74,076-010,15,011-015,"Lanyon took to his bed, and in something less than a fortnight he was dead"
273,251-275,51,051-055,"The night after the funeral, at which he had been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room, and sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set before him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal of his dead friend"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"“PRIVATE: for the hands of G"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"J"
153,151-175,25,021-025,"Utterson ALONE, and in case of his predecease to be destroyed unread,” so it was emphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the contents"
83,076-010,15,011-015,"“I have buried one friend to-day,” he thought: “what if this should cost me another"
68,076-010,14,011-015,"” And then he condemned the fear as a disloyalty, and broke the seal"
137,126-150,24,021-025,"Within there was another enclosure, likewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as “not to be opened till the death or disappearance of Dr"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"Henry Jekyll"
35,026-050,7,006-008,"” Utterson could not trust his eyes"
187,176-200,35,031-035,"Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the mad will which he had long ago restored to its author, here again were the idea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted"
142,126-150,28,026-030,"But in the will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man Hyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible"
50,051-075,10,009-010,"Written by the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean"
261,251-275,45,041-045,"A great curiosity came on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to his dead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his private safe"
184,176-200,33,031-035,"It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may be doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his surviving friend with the same eagerness"
70,076-010,12,011-015,"He thought of him kindly; but his thoughts were disquieted and fearful"
320,more,58,056-060,"He went to call indeed; but he was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart, he preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by the air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into that house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its inscrutable recluse"
55,051-075,9,009-010,"Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to communicate"
244,226-250,46,046-050,"The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimes even sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very silent, he did not read; it seemed as if he had something on his mind"
133,126-150,24,021-025,"Utterson became so used to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell off little by little in the frequency of his visits"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"INCIDENT AT THE WINDOW"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"It chanced on Sunday, when Mr"
38,026-050,8,006-008,"Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr"
134,126-150,26,026-030,"Enfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that when they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it"
54,051-075,10,009-010,"“Well,” said Enfield, “that story’s at an end at least"
29,026-050,7,006-008,"We shall never see more of Mr"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"Hyde"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
27,026-050,5,003-005,"“I hope not,” said Utterson"
78,076-010,16,016-020,"“Did I ever tell you that I once saw him, and shared your feeling of repulsion"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
69,076-010,12,011-015,"“It was impossible to do the one without the other,” returned Enfield"
97,076-010,23,021-025,"“And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that this was a back way to Dr"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Jekyll’s"
65,076-010,15,011-015,"It was partly your own fault that I found it out, even when I did"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
29,026-050,7,006-008,"“So you found it out, did you"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"” said Utterson"
77,076-010,18,016-020,"“But if that be so, we may step into the court and take a look at the windows"
127,126-150,27,026-030,"To tell you the truth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if the presence of a friend might do him good"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
139,126-150,25,021-025,"The court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature twilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with sunset"
181,176-200,31,031-035,"The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; and sitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of mien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Jekyll"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"“What"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Jekyll"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"” he cried"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"“I trust you are better"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
65,076-010,11,011-015,"“I am very low, Utterson,” replied the doctor drearily, “very low"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"It will not last long, thank God"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
44,051-075,8,006-008,"“You stay too much indoors,” said the lawyer"
55,051-075,10,009-010,"“You should be out, whipping up the circulation like Mr"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"Enfield and me"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"(This is my cousin—Mr"
10,011-025,1,000-002,"Enfield—Dr"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Jekyll"
54,051-075,13,011-015,") Come now; get your hat and take a quick turn with us"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
37,026-050,7,006-008,"“You are very good,” sighed the other"
79,076-010,17,016-020,"“I should like to very much; but no, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not"
104,101-125,22,021-025,"But indeed, Utterson, I am very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask you and Mr"
43,051-075,9,009-010,"Enfield up, but the place is really not fit"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
129,126-150,25,021-025,"“Why, then,” said the lawyer, good-naturedly, “the best thing we can do is to stay down here and speak with you from where we are"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
87,076-010,17,016-020,"“That is just what I was about to venture to propose,” returned the doctor with a smile"
195,176-200,36,036-040,"But the words were hardly uttered, before the smile was struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such abject terror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen below"
159,151-175,30,026-030,"They saw it but for a glimpse for the window was instantly thrust down; but that glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and left the court without a word"
189,176-200,33,031-035,"In silence, too, they traversed the by-street; and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring thoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some stirrings of life, that Mr"
51,051-075,9,009-010,"Utterson at last turned and looked at his companion"
68,076-010,13,011-015,"They were both pale; and there was an answering horror in their eyes"
41,051-075,8,006-008,"“God forgive us, God forgive us,” said Mr"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Utterson"
6,000-010,2,000-002,"But Mr"
79,076-010,14,011-015,"Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on once more in silence"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"THE LAST NIGHT"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Mr"
114,101-125,20,016-020,"Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when he was surprised to receive a visit from Poole"
38,026-050,7,006-008,"“Bless me, Poole, what brings you here"
64,076-010,14,011-015,"” he cried; and then taking a second look at him, “What ails you"
30,026-050,7,006-008,"” he added; “is the doctor ill"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"“Mr"
50,051-075,8,006-008,"Utterson,” said the man, “there is something wrong"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
67,076-010,15,011-015,"“Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,” said the lawyer"
55,051-075,11,011-015,"“Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
78,076-010,14,011-015,"“You know the doctor’s ways, sir,” replied Poole, “and how he shuts himself up"
95,076-010,22,021-025,"Well, he’s shut up again in the cabinet; and I don’t like it, sir—I wish I may die if I like it"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Mr"
25,026-050,4,003-005,"Utterson, sir, I’m afraid"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
49,051-075,9,009-010,"“Now, my good man,” said the lawyer, “be explicit"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"What are you afraid of"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
115,101-125,20,016-020,"“I’ve been afraid for about a week,” returned Poole, doggedly disregarding the question, “and I can bear it no more"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
196,176-200,37,036-040,"The man’s appearance amply bore out his words; his manner was altered for the worse; and except for the moment when he had first announced his terror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face"
108,101-125,23,021-025,"Even now, he sat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directed to a corner of the floor"
36,026-050,8,006-008,"“I can bear it no more,” he repeated"
106,101-125,19,016-020,"“Come,” said the lawyer, “I see you have some good reason, Poole; I see there is something seriously amiss"
25,026-050,7,006-008,"Try to tell me what it is"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
54,051-075,9,009-010,"“I think there’s been foul play,” said Poole, hoarsely"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"“Foul play"
93,076-010,16,016-020,"” cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather inclined to be irritated in consequence"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"“What foul play"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"What does the man mean"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
91,076-010,18,016-020,"“I daren’t say, sir,” was the answer; “but will you come along with me and see for yourself"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Mr"
248,226-250,46,046-050,"Utterson’s only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat; but he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared upon the butler’s face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was still untasted when he set it down to follow"
176,176-200,34,031-035,"It was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying on her back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture"
68,076-010,12,011-015,"The wind made talking difficult, and flecked the blood into the face"
81,076-010,14,011-015,"It seemed to have swept the streets unusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr"
66,076-010,12,011-015,"Utterson thought he had never seen that part of London so deserted"
227,226-250,42,041-045,"He could have wished it otherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity"
134,126-150,25,021-025,"The square, when they got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing"
201,201-225,40,036-040,"Poole, who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off his hat and mopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief"
207,201-225,40,036-040,"But for all the hurry of his coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he wiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face was white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken"
72,076-010,14,011-015,"“Well, sir,” he said, “here we are, and God grant there be nothing wrong"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
30,026-050,5,003-005,"“Amen, Poole,” said the lawyer"
140,126-150,26,026-030,"Thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door was opened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, “Is that you, Poole"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
28,026-050,5,003-005,"“It’s all right,” said Poole"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"“Open the door"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
189,176-200,35,031-035,"The hall, when they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was built high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and women, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep"
18,011-025,5,003-005,"At the sight of Mr"
93,076-010,14,011-015,"Utterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and the cook, crying out “Bless God"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"it’s Mr"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"Utterson,” ran forward as if to take him in her arms"
11,011-025,2,000-002,"“What, what"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"Are you all here"
27,026-050,5,003-005,"” said the lawyer peevishly"
69,076-010,11,011-015,"“Very irregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleased"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
32,026-050,5,003-005,"“They’re all afraid,” said Poole"
93,076-010,16,016-020,"Blank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted her voice and now wept loudly"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"“Hold your tongue"
256,251-275,46,046-050,"” Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent that testified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the girl had so suddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started and turned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation"
119,101-125,20,016-020,"“And now,” continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, “reach me a candle, and we’ll get this through hands at once"
23,026-050,6,006-008,"” And then he begged Mr"
58,051-075,12,011-015,"Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden"
51,051-075,11,011-015,"“Now, sir,” said he, “you come as gently as you can"
52,051-075,13,011-015,"I want you to hear, and I don’t want you to be heard"
66,076-010,16,016-020,"And see here, sir, if by any chance he was to ask you in, don’t go"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"Mr"
282,more,46,046-050,"Utterson’s nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk that nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage and followed the butler into the laboratory building through the surgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of the stair"
251,251-275,46,046-050,"Here Poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen; while he himself, setting down the candle and making a great and obvious call on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a somewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"“Mr"
121,101-125,24,021-025,"Utterson, sir, asking to see you,” he called; and even as he did so, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear"
83,076-010,14,011-015,"A voice answered from within: “Tell him I cannot see anyone,” it said complainingly"
117,101-125,23,021-025,"“Thank you, sir,” said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in his voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr"
122,101-125,23,021-025,"Utterson back across the yard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the beetles were leaping on the floor"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"“Sir,” he said, looking Mr"
49,051-075,9,009-010,"Utterson in the eyes, “Was that my master’s voice"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
80,076-010,14,011-015,"“It seems much changed,” replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look for look"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"“Changed"
39,026-050,8,006-008,"Well, yes, I think so,” said the butler"
77,076-010,15,011-015,"“Have I been twenty years in this man’s house, to be deceived about his voice"
214,201-225,45,041-045,"No, sir; master’s made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when we heard him cry out upon the name of God; and who’s in there instead of him, and why it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Utterson"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
80,076-010,17,016-020,"“This is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale my man,” said Mr"
27,026-050,4,003-005,"Utterson, biting his finger"
45,051-075,8,006-008,"“Suppose it were as you suppose, supposing Dr"
73,076-010,12,011-015,"Jekyll to have been—well, murdered what could induce the murderer to stay"
58,051-075,10,009-010,"That won’t hold water; it doesn’t commend itself to reason"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"“Well, Mr"
72,076-010,15,011-015,"Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I’ll do it yet,” said Poole"
176,176-200,36,036-040,"“All this last week (you must know) him, or it, whatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and day for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind"
112,101-125,22,021-025,"It was sometimes his way—the master’s, that is—to write his orders on a sheet of paper and throw it on the stair"
149,126-150,28,026-030,"We’ve had nothing else this week back; nothing but papers, and a closed door, and the very meals left there to be smuggled in when nobody was looking"
168,151-175,32,031-035,"Well, sir, every day, ay, and twice and thrice in the same day, there have been orders and complaints, and I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists in town"
153,151-175,29,026-030,"Every time I brought the stuff back, there would be another paper telling me to return it, because it was not pure, and another order to a different firm"
49,051-075,9,009-010,"This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir, whatever for"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"“Have you any of these papers"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"” asked Mr"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Utterson"
123,101-125,21,021-025,"Poole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which the lawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"Its contents ran thus: “Dr"
41,051-075,6,006-008,"Jekyll presents his compliments to Messrs"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"Maw"
90,076-010,16,016-020,"He assures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his present purpose"
19,011-025,5,003-005,"In the year 18—, Dr"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"J"
47,051-075,7,006-008,"purchased a somewhat large quantity from Messrs"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"M"
121,101-125,25,021-025,"He now begs them to search with most sedulous care, and should any of the same quality be left, forward it to him at once"
27,026-050,4,003-005,"Expense is no consideration"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"The importance of this to Dr"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"J"
25,026-050,4,003-005,"can hardly be exaggerated"
128,126-150,24,021-025,"” So far the letter had run composedly enough, but here with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writer’s emotion had broken loose"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"“For God’s sake,” he added, “find me some of the old"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"“This is a strange note,” said Mr"
60,051-075,12,011-015,"Utterson; and then sharply, “How do you come to have it open"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
100,076-010,21,021-025,"“The man at Maw’s was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me like so much dirt,” returned Poole"
54,051-075,9,009-010,"“This is unquestionably the doctor’s hand, do you know"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"” resumed the lawyer"
125,101-125,22,021-025,"“I thought it looked like it,” said the servant rather sulkily; and then, with another voice, “But what matters hand of write"
9,011-025,3,003-005,"” he said"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"“I’ve seen him"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"“Seen him"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"” repeated Mr"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Utterson"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"“Well"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"“That’s it"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"” said Poole"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"“It was this way"
48,051-075,9,009-010,"I came suddenly into the theatre from the garden"
168,151-175,36,036-040,"It seems he had slipped out to look for this drug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he was at the far end of the room digging among the crates"
86,076-010,18,016-020,"He looked up when I came in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped upstairs into the cabinet"
85,076-010,19,016-020,"It was but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood upon my head like quills"
59,051-075,14,011-015,"Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask upon his face"
67,076-010,17,016-020,"If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat, and run from me"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"I have served him long enough"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"And then"
50,051-075,11,011-015,"” The man paused and passed his hand over his face"
51,051-075,8,006-008,"“These are all very strange circumstances,” said Mr"
46,051-075,9,009-010,"Utterson, “but I think I begin to see daylight"
354,more,63,more,"Your master, Poole, is plainly seized with one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer; hence, for aught I know, the alteration of his voice; hence the mask and the avoidance of his friends; hence his eagerness to find this drug, by means of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimate recovery—God grant that he be not deceived"
173,151-175,30,026-030,"There is my explanation; it is sad enough, Poole, ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plain and natural, hangs well together, and delivers us from all exorbitant alarms"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
113,101-125,21,021-025,"“Sir,” said the butler, turning to a sort of mottled pallor, “that thing was not my master, and there’s the truth"
118,101-125,24,021-025,"My master”—here he looked round him and began to whisper—“is a tall, fine build of a man, and this was more of a dwarf"
31,026-050,5,003-005,"” Utterson attempted to protest"
79,076-010,16,016-020,"“O, sir,” cried Poole, “do you think I do not know my master after twenty years"
112,101-125,25,021-025,"Do you think I do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door, where I saw him every morning of my life"
44,051-075,10,009-010,"No, sir, that thing in the mask was never Dr"
49,051-075,10,009-010,"Jekyll—God knows what it was, but it was never Dr"
67,076-010,14,011-015,"Jekyll; and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
85,076-010,16,016-020,"“Poole,” replied the lawyer, “if you say that, it will become my duty to make certain"
177,176-200,37,036-040,"Much as I desire to spare your master’s feelings, much as I am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still alive, I shall consider it my duty to break in that door"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"“Ah, Mr"
24,026-050,3,003-005,"Utterson, that’s talking"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"” cried the butler"
77,076-010,14,011-015,"“And now comes the second question,” resumed Utterson: “Who is going to do it"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
47,051-075,9,009-010,"“Why, you and me, sir,” was the undaunted reply"
124,101-125,24,021-025,"“That’s very well said,” returned the lawyer; “and whatever comes of it, I shall make it my business to see you are no loser"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
101,101-125,18,016-020,"“There is an axe in the theatre,” continued Poole; “and you might take the kitchen poker for yourself"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
79,076-010,14,011-015,"The lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand, and balanced it"
115,101-125,23,021-025,"“Do you know, Poole,” he said, looking up, “that you and I are about to place ourselves in a position of some peril"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
50,051-075,9,009-010,"“You may say so, sir, indeed,” returned the butler"
58,051-075,12,011-015,"“It is well, then that we should be frank,” said the other"
65,076-010,14,011-015,"“We both think more than we have said; let us make a clean breast"
53,051-075,10,009-010,"This masked figure that you saw, did you recognise it"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
116,101-125,23,021-025,"“Well, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up, that I could hardly swear to that,” was the answer"
27,026-050,7,006-008,"“But if you mean, was it Mr"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"Hyde"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"—why, yes, I think it was"
146,126-150,31,031-035,"You see, it was much of the same bigness; and it had the same quick, light way with it; and then who else could have got in by the laboratory door"
86,076-010,19,016-020,"You have not forgot, sir, that at the time of the murder he had still the key with him"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"But that’s not all"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"I don’t know, Mr"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"Utterson, if you ever met this Mr"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"Hyde"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
46,051-075,9,009-010,"“Yes,” said the lawyer, “I once spoke with him"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
235,226-250,46,046-050,"“Then you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something queer about that gentleman—something that gave a man a turn—I don’t know rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in your marrow kind of cold and thin"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
54,051-075,11,011-015,"“I own I felt something of what you describe,” said Mr"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Utterson"
31,026-050,5,003-005,"“Quite so, sir,” returned Poole"
136,126-150,25,021-025,"“Well, when that masked thing like a monkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet, it went down my spine like ice"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"O, I know it’s not evidence, Mr"
110,101-125,21,021-025,"Utterson; I’m book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and I give you my bible-word it was Mr"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"Hyde"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"“Ay, ay,” said the lawyer"
35,026-050,7,006-008,"“My fears incline to the same point"
62,076-010,10,009-010,"Evil, I fear, founded—evil was sure to come—of that connection"
160,151-175,30,026-030,"Ay truly, I believe you; I believe poor Harry is killed; and I believe his murderer (for what purpose, God alone can tell) is still lurking in his victim’s room"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"Well, let our name be vengeance"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"Call Bradshaw"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
55,051-075,10,009-010,"The footman came at the summons, very white and nervous"
51,051-075,7,006-008,"“Pull yourself together, Bradshaw,” said the lawyer"
100,076-010,22,021-025,"“This suspense, I know, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our intention to make an end of it"
62,076-010,13,011-015,"Poole, here, and I are going to force our way into the cabinet"
63,076-010,13,011-015,"If all is well, my shoulders are broad enough to bear the blame"
204,201-225,39,036-040,"Meanwhile, lest anything should really be amiss, or any malefactor seek to escape by the back, you and the boy must go round the corner with a pair of good sticks and take your post at the laboratory door"
47,051-075,10,009-010,"We give you ten minutes to get to your stations"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
48,051-075,9,009-010,"As Bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch"
108,101-125,23,021-025,"“And now, Poole, let us get to ours,” he said; and taking the poker under his arm, led the way into the yard"
60,051-075,13,011-015,"The scud had banked over the moon, and it was now quite dark"
228,226-250,43,041-045,"The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that deep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro about their steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre, where they sat down silently to wait"
154,151-175,28,026-030,"London hummed solemnly all around; but nearer at hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a footfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor"
86,076-010,17,016-020,"“So it will walk all day, sir,” whispered Poole; “ay, and the better part of the night"
71,076-010,15,011-015,"Only when a new sample comes from the chemist, there’s a bit of a break"
55,051-075,11,011-015,"Ah, it’s an ill conscience that’s such an enemy to rest"
54,051-075,11,011-015,"Ah, sir, there’s blood foully shed in every step of it"
63,076-010,12,011-015,"But hark again, a little closer—put your heart in your ears, Mr"
48,051-075,9,009-010,"Utterson, and tell me, is that the doctor’s foot"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
154,151-175,28,026-030,"The steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they went so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread of Henry Jekyll"
15,011-025,2,000-002,"Utterson sighed"
29,026-050,5,003-005,"“Is there never anything else"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"” he asked"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"Poole nodded"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"“Once,” he said"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"“Once I heard it weeping"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"“Weeping"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"how that"
56,051-075,11,011-015,"” said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of horror"
54,051-075,11,011-015,"“Weeping like a woman or a lost soul,” said the butler"
64,076-010,14,011-015,"“I came away with that upon my heart, that I could have wept too"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
38,026-050,9,009-010,"But now the ten minutes drew to an end"
265,251-275,52,051-055,"Poole disinterred the axe from under a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the nearest table to light them to the attack; and they drew near with bated breath to where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and down, in the quiet of the night"
65,076-010,12,011-015,"“Jekyll,” cried Utterson, with a loud voice, “I demand to see you"
45,051-075,10,009-010,"” He paused a moment, but there came no reply"
176,176-200,34,031-035,"“I give you fair warning, our suspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see you,” he resumed; “if not by fair means, then by foul—if not of your consent, then by brute force"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
55,051-075,9,009-010,"“Utterson,” said the voice, “for God’s sake, have mercy"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
42,051-075,6,006-008,"“Ah, that’s not Jekyll’s voice—it’s Hyde’s"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"” cried Utterson"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"“Down with the door, Poole"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
125,101-125,23,021-025,"Poole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building, and the red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges"
65,076-010,12,011-015,"A dismal screech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet"
276,more,53,051-055,"Up went the axe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four times the blow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were of excellent workmanship; and it was not until the fifth, that the lock burst and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet"
113,101-125,20,016-020,"The besiegers, appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had succeeded, stood back a little and peered in"
401,more,72,more,"There lay the cabinet before their eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing and chattering on the hearth, the kettle singing its thin strain, a drawer or two open, papers neatly set forth on the business table, and nearer the fire, the things laid out for tea; the quietest room, you would have said, and, but for the glazed presses full of chemicals, the most commonplace that night in London"
84,076-010,16,016-020,"Right in the middle there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and still twitching"
82,076-010,17,016-020,"They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back and beheld the face of Edward Hyde"
325,more,63,more,"He was dressed in clothes far too large for him, clothes of the doctor’s bigness; the cords of his face still moved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone; and by the crushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung upon the air, Utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a self-destroyer"
68,076-010,13,011-015,"“We have come too late,” he said sternly, “whether to save or punish"
87,076-010,19,016-020,"Hyde is gone to his account; and it only remains for us to find the body of your master"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
229,226-250,41,041-045,"The far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre, which filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above, and by the cabinet, which formed an upper storey at one end and looked upon the court"
138,126-150,24,021-025,"A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the by-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a second flight of stairs"
59,051-075,11,011-015,"There were besides a few dark closets and a spacious cellar"
38,026-050,6,006-008,"All these they now thoroughly examined"
125,101-125,24,021-025,"Each closet needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell from their doors, had stood long unopened"
297,more,53,051-055,"The cellar, indeed, was filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was Jekyll’s predecessor; but even as they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance"
58,051-075,11,011-015,"Nowhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive"
42,051-075,8,006-008,"Poole stamped on the flags of the corridor"
58,051-075,11,011-015,"“He must be buried here,” he said, hearkening to the sound"
88,076-010,17,016-020,"“Or he may have fled,” said Utterson, and he turned to examine the door in the by-street"
92,076-010,18,016-020,"It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, they found the key, already stained with rust"
50,051-075,9,009-010,"“This does not look like use,” observed the lawyer"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"“Use"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"” echoed Poole"
34,026-050,8,006-008,"“Do you not see, sir, it is broken"
34,026-050,9,009-010,"much as if a man had stamped on it"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
60,051-075,9,009-010,"“Ay,” continued Utterson, “and the fractures, too, are rusty"
47,051-075,11,011-015,"” The two men looked at each other with a scare"
43,051-075,8,006-008,"“This is beyond me, Poole,” said the lawyer"
30,026-050,7,006-008,"“Let us go back to the cabinet"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
163,151-175,27,026-030,"They mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional awestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine the contents of the cabinet"
192,176-200,34,031-035,"At one table, there were traces of chemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on glass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had been prevented"
135,126-150,26,026-030,"“That is the same drug that I was always bringing him,” said Poole; and even as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over"
156,151-175,29,026-030,"This brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn cosily up, and the tea things stood ready to the sitter’s elbow, the very sugar in the cup"
246,226-250,45,041-045,"There were several books on a shelf; one lay beside the tea things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy of a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great esteem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies"
148,126-150,25,021-025,"Next, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came to the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary horror"
230,226-250,43,041-045,"But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow playing on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along the glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and fearful countenances stooping to look in"
63,076-010,10,009-010,"“This glass has seen some strange things, sir,” whispered Poole"
75,076-010,13,011-015,"“And surely none stranger than itself,” echoed the lawyer in the same tones"
133,126-150,23,021-025,"“For what did Jekyll”—he caught himself up at the word with a start, and then conquering the weakness—“what could Jekyll want with it"
9,011-025,3,003-005,"” he said"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"“You may say that"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"” said Poole"
38,026-050,7,006-008,"Next they turned to the business table"
123,101-125,24,021-025,"On the desk, among the neat array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the doctor’s hand, the name of Mr"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Utterson"
64,076-010,11,011-015,"The lawyer unsealed it, and several enclosures fell to the floor"
317,more,61,more,"The first was a will, drawn in the same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months before, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the lawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John Utterson"
112,101-125,22,021-025,"He looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"“My head goes round,” he said"
154,151-175,30,026-030,"“He has been all these days in possession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see himself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
90,076-010,20,016-020,"He caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor’s hand and dated at the top"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"“O Poole"
51,051-075,11,011-015,"” the lawyer cried, “he was alive and here this day"
94,076-010,20,016-020,"He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; he must be still alive, he must have fled"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"And then, why fled"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"and how"
56,051-075,11,011-015,"and in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide"

27,026-050,6,006-008,"“Why don’t you read it, sir"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"” asked Poole"
45,051-075,7,006-008,"“Because I fear,” replied the lawyer solemnly"
33,026-050,8,006-008,"“God grant I have no cause for it"
69,076-010,15,011-015,"” And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read as follows:"
260,251-275,45,041-045,"“My dear Utterson,—When this shall fall into your hands, I shall have disappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to foresee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless situation tell me that the end is sure and must be early"
147,126-150,30,026-030,"Go then, and first read the narrative which Lanyon warned me he was to place in your hands; and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of"

28,026-050,5,003-005,"“There was a third enclosure"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"” asked Utterson"
95,076-010,16,016-020,"“Here, sir,” said Poole, and gave into his hands a considerable packet sealed in several places"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"The lawyer put it in his pocket"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"“I would say nothing of this paper"
67,076-010,15,011-015,"If your master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit"
135,126-150,28,026-030,"It is now ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shall be back before midnight, when we shall send for the police"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
241,226-250,44,041-045,"They went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and Utterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the hall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which this mystery was now to be explained"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"DR"
18,011-025,2,000-002,"LANYON’S NARRATIVE"
178,176-200,31,031-035,"On the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening delivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague and old school companion, Henry Jekyll"
247,226-250,45,041-045,"I was a good deal surprised by this; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I had seen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I could imagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality of registration"
65,076-010,12,011-015,"The contents increased my wonder; for this is how the letter ran:"
19,011-025,3,003-005,"“10th December, 18—"
182,176-200,32,031-035,"“Dear Lanyon,—You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may have differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at least on my side, any break in our affection"
161,151-175,33,031-035,"There was never a day when, if you had said to me, ‘Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason, depend upon you,’ I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you"
95,076-010,20,016-020,"Lanyon my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you fail me to-night, I am lost"
102,101-125,18,016-020,"You might suppose, after this preface, that I am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"Judge for yourself"
268,251-275,49,046-050,"“I want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night—ay, even if you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless your carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in your hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house"
89,076-010,16,016-020,"Poole, my butler, has his orders; you will find him waiting your arrival with a locksmith"
299,more,63,more,"The door of my cabinet is then to be forced; and you are to go in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand, breaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, with all its contents as they stand, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is the same thing) the third from the bottom"
186,176-200,38,036-040,"In my extreme distress of mind, I have a morbid fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in error, you may know the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a phial and a paper book"
88,076-010,18,016-020,"This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you to Cavendish Square exactly as it stands"
58,051-075,12,011-015,"“That is the first part of the service: now for the second"
324,more,65,more,"You should be back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before midnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor foreseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be preferred for what will then remain to do"
248,226-250,51,051-055,"At midnight, then, I have to ask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own hand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to place in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from my cabinet"
70,076-010,12,011-015,"Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude completely"
289,more,49,046-050,"Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation, you will have understood that these arrangements are of capital importance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they must appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or the shipwreck of my reason"
139,126-150,27,026-030,"“Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart sinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility"
230,226-250,44,041-045,"Think of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a blackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware that, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away like a story that is told"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"Serve me, my dear Lanyon and save"

113,101-125,20,016-020,"It is possible that the post-office may fail me, and this letter not come into your hands until to-morrow morning"
152,151-175,30,026-030,"In that case, dear Lanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the course of the day; and once more expect my messenger at midnight"
130,126-150,26,026-030,"It may then already be too late; and if that night passes without event, you will know that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
162,151-175,31,031-035,"Upon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane; but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound to do as he requested"
173,151-175,33,031-035,"The less I understood of this farrago, the less I was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave responsibility"
86,076-010,15,011-015,"I rose accordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to Jekyll’s house"
165,151-175,31,031-035,"The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by the same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent at once for a locksmith and a carpenter"
79,076-010,17,016-020,"The tradesmen came while we were yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr"
120,101-125,17,016-020,"Denman’s surgical theatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll’s private cabinet is most conveniently entered"
183,176-200,34,031-035,"The door was very strong, the lock excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and have to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was near despair"
80,076-010,16,016-020,"But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour’s work, the door stood open"
149,126-150,30,026-030,"The press marked E was unlocked; and I took out the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and returned with it to Cavendish Square"
40,026-050,7,006-008,"Here I proceeded to examine its contents"
262,251-275,49,046-050,"The powders were neatly enough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so that it was plain they were of Jekyll’s private manufacture; and when I opened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple crystalline salt of a white colour"
212,201-225,39,036-040,"The phial, to which I next turned my attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor, which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to contain phosphorus and some volatile ether"
46,051-075,9,009-010,"At the other ingredients I could make no guess"
80,076-010,15,011-015,"The book was an ordinary version book and contained little but a series of dates"
113,101-125,21,021-025,"These covered a period of many years, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and quite abruptly"
258,251-275,46,046-050,"Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date, usually no more than a single word: “double” occurring perhaps six times in a total of several hundred entries; and once very early in the list and followed by several marks of exclamation, “total failure"
76,076-010,14,011-015,"” All this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was definite"
163,151-175,30,026-030,"Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of experiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll’s investigations) to no end of practical usefulness"
126,126-150,23,021-025,"How could the presence of these articles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life of my flighty colleague"
70,076-010,15,011-015,"If his messenger could go to one place, why could he not go to another"
88,076-010,16,016-020,"And even granting some impediment, why was this gentleman to be received by me in secret"
221,201-225,42,041-045,"The more I reflected the more convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral disease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old revolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence"
95,076-010,17,016-020,"Twelve o’clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded very gently on the door"
96,076-010,18,016-020,"I went myself at the summons, and found a small man crouching against the pillars of the portico"
21,011-025,5,003-005,"“Are you come from Dr"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Jekyll"
9,011-025,3,003-005,"” I asked"
162,151-175,31,031-035,"He told me “yes” by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him enter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into the darkness of the square"
140,126-150,26,026-030,"There was a policeman not far off, advancing with his bull’s eye open; and at the sight, I thought my visitor started and made greater haste"
155,151-175,28,026-030,"These particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I followed him into the bright light of the consulting room, I kept my hand ready on my weapon"
51,051-075,11,011-015,"Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him"
55,051-075,12,011-015,"I had never set eyes on him before, so much was certain"
284,more,44,041-045,"He was small, as I have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his face, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and great apparent debility of constitution, and—last but not least—with the odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood"
100,076-010,17,016-020,"This bore some resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked sinking of the pulse"
274,251-275,52,051-055,"At the time, I set it down to some idiosyncratic, personal distaste, and merely wondered at the acuteness of the symptoms; but I have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much deeper in the nature of man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the principle of hatred"
503,more,90,more,"This person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance, struck in me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiosity) was dressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable; his clothes, that is to say, although they were of rich and sober fabric, were enormously too large for him in every measurement—the trousers hanging on his legs and rolled up to keep them from the ground, the waist of the coat below his haunches, and the collar sprawling wide upon his shoulders"
81,076-010,13,011-015,"Strange to relate, this ludicrous accoutrement was far from moving me to laughter"
371,more,64,more,"Rather, as there was something abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature that now faced me—something seizing, surprising and revolting—this fresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it; so that to my interest in the man’s nature and character, there was added a curiosity as to his origin, his life, his fortune and status in the world"
113,101-125,23,021-025,"These observations, though they have taken so great a space to be set down in, were yet the work of a few seconds"
54,051-075,9,009-010,"My visitor was, indeed, on fire with sombre excitement"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"“Have you got it"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"” he cried"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"“Have you got it"
96,076-010,21,021-025,"” And so lively was his impatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought to shake me"
75,076-010,16,016-020,"I put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along my blood"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"“Come, sir,” said I"
65,076-010,12,011-015,"“You forget that I have not yet the pleasure of your acquaintance"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"Be seated, if you please"
261,251-275,52,051-055,"” And I showed him an example, and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as fair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness of the hour, the nature of my preoccupations, and the horror I had of my visitor, would suffer me to muster"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"“I beg your pardon, Dr"
34,026-050,5,003-005,"Lanyon,” he replied civilly enough"
90,076-010,17,016-020,"“What you say is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to my politeness"
49,051-075,10,009-010,"I come here at the instance of your colleague, Dr"
69,076-010,13,011-015,"Henry Jekyll, on a piece of business of some moment; and I understood"
179,176-200,33,031-035,"” He paused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of his collected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of the hysteria—“I understood, a drawer"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
91,076-010,17,016-020,"But here I took pity on my visitor’s suspense, and some perhaps on my own growing curiosity"
125,101-125,25,021-025,"“There it is, sir,” said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on the floor behind a table and still covered with the sheet"
220,201-225,45,041-045,"He sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart; I could hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; and his face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed both for his life and reason"
26,026-050,4,003-005,"“Compose yourself,” said I"
96,076-010,19,016-020,"He turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of despair, plucked away the sheet"
93,076-010,18,016-020,"At sight of the contents, he uttered one loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrified"
103,101-125,19,016-020,"And the next moment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control, “Have you a graduated glass"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"” he asked"
75,076-010,16,016-020,"I rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him what he asked"
108,101-125,22,021-025,"He thanked me with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of the red tincture and added one of the powders"
179,176-200,32,031-035,"The mixture, which was at first of a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the crystals melted, to brighten in colour, to effervesce audibly, and to throw off small fumes of vapour"
145,126-150,26,026-030,"Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition ceased and the compound changed to a dark purple, which faded again more slowly to a watery green"
166,151-175,31,031-035,"My visitor, who had watched these metamorphoses with a keen eye, smiled, set down the glass upon the table, and then turned and looked upon me with an air of scrutiny"
43,051-075,8,006-008,"“And now,” said he, “to settle what remains"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"Will you be wise"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"will you be guided"
103,101-125,21,021-025,"will you suffer me to take this glass in my hand and to go forth from your house without further parley"
53,051-075,11,011-015,"or has the greed of curiosity too much command of you"
59,051-075,12,011-015,"Think before you answer, for it shall be done as you decide"
194,176-200,39,036-040,"As you decide, you shall be left as you were before, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service rendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches of the soul"
242,226-250,48,046-050,"Or, if you shall so prefer to choose, a new province of knowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you, here, in this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blasted by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
182,176-200,33,031-035,"“Sir,” said I, affecting a coolness that I was far from truly possessing, “you speak enigmas, and you will perhaps not wonder that I hear you with no very strong impression of belief"
89,076-010,19,016-020,"But I have gone too far in the way of inexplicable services to pause before I see the end"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"“It is well,” replied my visitor"
81,076-010,14,011-015,"“Lanyon, you remember your vows: what follows is under the seal of our profession"
181,176-200,31,031-035,"And now, you who have so long been bound to the most narrow and material views, you who have denied the virtue of transcendental medicine, you who have derided your superiors—behold"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
50,051-075,12,011-015,"He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp"
419,more,75,more,"A cry followed; he reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with injected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I thought, a change—he seemed to swell—his face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and alter—and the next moment, I had sprung to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arms raised to shield me from that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror"
6,000-010,2,000-002,"“O God"
24,026-050,6,006-008,"” I screamed, and “O God"
174,151-175,30,026-030,"” again and again; for there before my eyes—pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with his hands, like a man restored from death—there stood Henry Jekyll"
72,076-010,17,016-020,"What he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set on paper"
169,151-175,38,036-040,"I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul sickened at it; and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes, I ask myself if I believe it, and I cannot answer"
208,201-225,44,041-045,"My life is shaken to its roots; sleep has left me; the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of the day and night; and I feel that my days are numbered, and that I must die; and yet I shall die incredulous"
145,126-150,28,026-030,"As for the moral turpitude that man unveiled to me, even with tears of penitence, I cannot, even in memory, dwell on it without a start of horror"
111,101-125,23,021-025,"I will say but one thing, Utterson, and that (if you can bring your mind to credit it) will be more than enough"
174,151-175,34,031-035,"The creature who crept into my house that night was, on Jekyll’s own confession, known by the name of Hyde and hunted for in every corner of the land as the murderer of Carew"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"HASTIE LANYON"
41,051-075,7,006-008,"HENRY JEKYLL’S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE"
279,more,49,046-050,"I was born in the year 18— to a large fortune, endowed besides with excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of the wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have been supposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished future"
275,251-275,51,051-055,"And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient gaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such as I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my head high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the public"
237,226-250,44,041-045,"Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that when I reached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take stock of my progress and position in the world, I stood already committed to a profound duplicity of life"
186,176-200,37,036-040,"Many a man would have even blazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high views that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost morbid sense of shame"
277,more,51,051-055,"It was thus rather the exacting nature of my aspirations than any particular degradation in my faults, that made me what I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men, severed in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound man’s dual nature"
175,151-175,34,031-035,"In this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress"
287,more,55,051-055,"Though so profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides of me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside restraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye of day, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and suffering"
211,201-225,35,031-035,"And it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies, which led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted and shed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my members"
247,226-250,45,041-045,"With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth, by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two"
80,076-010,16,016-020,"I say two, because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point"
191,176-200,32,031-035,"Others will follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines; and I hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of multifarious, incongruous and independent denizens"
106,101-125,20,016-020,"I, for my part, from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in one direction only"
541,more,101,more,"It was on the moral side, and in my own person, that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man; I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was only because I was radically both; and from an early date, even before the course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most naked possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with pleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of these elements"
420,more,74,more,"If each, I told myself, could be housed in separate identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the unjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of his more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil"
179,176-200,27,026-030,"It was the curse of mankind that these incongruous faggots were thus bound together—that in the agonised womb of consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling"
31,026-050,5,003-005,"How, then were they dissociated"
123,101-125,25,021-025,"I was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light began to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table"
176,176-200,30,026-030,"I began to perceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling immateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body in which we walk attired"
140,126-150,27,026-030,"Certain agents I found to have the power to shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss the curtains of a pavilion"
90,076-010,16,016-020,"For two good reasons, I will not enter deeply into this scientific branch of my confession"
229,226-250,45,041-045,"First, because I have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound for ever on man’s shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful pressure"
48,051-075,8,006-008,"Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas"
43,051-075,6,006-008,"too evident, my discoveries were incomplete"
390,more,70,more,"Enough then, that I not only recognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain of the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by which these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a second form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to me because they were the expression, and bore the stamp of lower elements in my soul"
65,076-010,13,011-015,"I hesitated long before I put this theory to the test of practice"
291,more,52,051-055,"I knew well that I risked death; for any drug that so potently controlled and shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple of an overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition, utterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it to change"
100,076-010,17,016-020,"But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at last overcame the suggestions of alarm"
400,more,70,more,"I had long since prepared my tincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a large quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments, to be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, I compounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke together in the glass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of courage, drank off the potion"
154,151-175,29,026-030,"The most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour of birth or death"
95,076-010,19,016-020,"Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and I came to myself as if out of a great sickness"
118,101-125,17,016-020,"There was something strange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its very novelty, incredibly sweet"
255,251-275,45,041-045,"I felt younger, lighter, happier in body; within I was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of disordered sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, a solution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent freedom of the soul"
193,176-200,37,036-040,"I knew myself, at the first breath of this new life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my original evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me like wine"
136,126-150,26,026-030,"I stretched out my hands, exulting in the freshness of these sensations; and in the act, I was suddenly aware that I had lost in stature"
163,151-175,31,031-035,"There was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside me as I write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose of these transformations"
308,more,59,056-060,"The night however, was far gone into the morning—the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the conception of the day—the inmates of my house were locked in the most rigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with hope and triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom"
330,more,59,056-060,"I crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I could have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that their unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through the corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I saw for the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde"
109,101-125,22,021-025,"I must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but that which I suppose to be most probable"
155,151-175,29,026-030,"The evil side of my nature, to which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust and less developed than the good which I had just deposed"
165,151-175,31,031-035,"Again, in the course of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of effort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and much less exhausted"
113,101-125,21,021-025,"And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde was so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll"
113,101-125,22,021-025,"Even as good shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly and plainly on the face of the other"
126,126-150,25,021-025,"Evil besides (which I must still believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint of deformity and decay"
117,101-125,24,021-025,"And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in the glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of welcome"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"This, too, was myself"
27,026-050,5,003-005,"It seemed natural and human"
172,151-175,31,031-035,"In my eyes it bore a livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and single, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto accustomed to call mine"
35,026-050,8,006-008,"And in so far I was doubtless right"
139,126-150,27,026-030,"I have observed that when I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come near to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh"
165,151-175,33,031-035,"This, as I take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are commingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil"
447,more,83,more,"I lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive experiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a house that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I once more prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs of dissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, the stature and the face of Henry Jekyll"
46,051-075,9,009-010,"That night I had come to the fatal cross-roads"
256,251-275,47,046-050,"Had I approached my discovery in a more noble spirit, had I risked the experiment while under the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have been otherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come forth an angel instead of a fiend"
206,201-225,35,031-035,"The drug had no discriminating action; it was neither diabolical nor divine; it but shook the doors of the prisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi, that which stood within ran forth"
158,151-175,29,026-030,"At that time my virtue slumbered; my evil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the occasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward Hyde"
231,226-250,39,036-040,"Hence, although I had now two characters as well as two appearances, one was wholly evil, and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, that incongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had already learned to despair"
45,051-075,8,006-008,"The movement was thus wholly toward the worse"
85,076-010,18,016-020,"Even at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of a life of study"
251,251-275,44,041-045,"I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my pleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only well known and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this incoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome"
72,076-010,16,016-020,"It was on this side that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery"
131,126-150,28,026-030,"I had but to drink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to assume, like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde"
123,101-125,25,021-025,"I smiled at the notion; it seemed to me at the time to be humourous; and I made my preparations with the most studious care"
168,151-175,32,031-035,"I took and furnished that house in Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as a housekeeper a creature whom I knew well to be silent and unscrupulous"
55,051-075,12,011-015,"On the other side, I announced to my servants that a Mr"
182,176-200,34,031-035,"Hyde (whom I described) was to have full liberty and power about my house in the square; and to parry mishaps, I even called and made myself a familiar object, in my second character"
105,101-125,23,021-025,"I next drew up that will to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me in the person of Dr"
67,076-010,12,011-015,"Jekyll, I could enter on that of Edward Hyde without pecuniary loss"
108,101-125,20,016-020,"And thus fortified, as I supposed, on every side, I began to profit by the strange immunities of my position"
110,101-125,18,016-020,"Men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own person and reputation sat under shelter"
50,051-075,11,011-015,"I was the first that ever did so for his pleasures"
191,176-200,36,036-040,"I was the first that could plod in the public eye with a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a schoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of liberty"
62,076-010,11,011-015,"But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety was complete"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"Think of it—I did not even exist"
379,more,73,more,"Let me but escape into my laboratory door, give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the draught that I had always standing ready; and whatever he had done, Edward Hyde would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror; and there in his stead, quietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in his study, a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henry Jekyll"
123,101-125,24,021-025,"The pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I have said, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term"
77,076-010,15,011-015,"But in the hands of Edward Hyde, they soon began to turn toward the monstrous"
113,101-125,21,021-025,"When I would come back from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kind of wonder at my vicarious depravity"
292,more,52,051-055,"This familiar that I called out of my own soul, and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a being inherently malign and villainous; his every act and thought centered on self; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture to another; relentless like a man of stone"
162,151-175,27,026-030,"Henry Jekyll stood at times aghast before the acts of Edward Hyde; but the situation was apart from ordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience"
55,051-075,11,011-015,"It was Hyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty"
157,151-175,29,026-030,"Jekyll was no worse; he woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would even make haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde"
33,026-050,5,003-005,"And thus his conscience slumbered"
239,226-250,45,041-045,"Into the details of the infamy at which I thus connived (for even now I can scarce grant that I committed it) I have no design of entering; I mean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which my chastisement approached"
92,076-010,18,016-020,"I met with one accident which, as it brought on no consequence, I shall no more than mention"
389,more,77,more,"An act of cruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I recognised the other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and the child’s family joined him; there were moments when I feared for my life; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward Hyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in the name of Henry Jekyll"
255,251-275,48,046-050,"But this danger was easily eliminated from the future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of Edward Hyde himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied my double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate"
177,176-200,35,031-035,"Some two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I had been out for one of my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the next day in bed with somewhat odd sensations"
405,more,82,more,"It was in vain I looked about me; in vain I saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my room in the square; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bed curtains and the design of the mahogany frame; something still kept insisting that I was not where I was, that I had not wakened where I seemed to be, but in the little room in Soho where I was accustomed to sleep in the body of Edward Hyde"
186,176-200,32,031-035,"I smiled to myself, and in my psychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of this illusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a comfortable morning doze"
89,076-010,19,016-020,"I was still so engaged when, in one of my more wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand"
130,126-150,24,021-025,"Now the hand of Henry Jekyll (as you have often remarked) was professional in shape and size; it was large, firm, white and comely"
217,201-225,40,036-040,"But the hand which I now saw, clearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half shut on the bedclothes, was lean, corded, knuckly, of a dusky pallor and thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair"
30,026-050,7,006-008,"It was the hand of Edward Hyde"
229,226-250,47,046-050,"I must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was in the mere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my breast as sudden and startling as the crash of cymbals; and bounding from my bed I rushed to the mirror"
91,076-010,17,016-020,"At the sight that met my eyes, my blood was changed into something exquisitely thin and icy"
63,076-010,13,011-015,"Yes, I had gone to bed Henry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"How was this to be explained"
80,076-010,15,011-015,"I asked myself; and then, with another bound of terror—how was it to be remedied"
255,251-275,45,041-045,"It was well on in the morning; the servants were up; all my drugs were in the cabinet—a long journey down two pairs of stairs, through the back passage, across the open court and through the anatomical theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck"
129,126-150,26,026-030,"It might indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what use was that, when I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature"
154,151-175,29,026-030,"And then with an overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon my mind that the servants were already used to the coming and going of my second self"
153,151-175,31,031-035,"I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of my own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared and drew back at seeing Mr"
75,076-010,16,016-020,"Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange array; and ten minutes later, Dr"
112,101-125,21,021-025,"Jekyll had returned to his own shape and was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of breakfasting"
28,026-050,5,003-005,"Small indeed was my appetite"
273,251-275,45,041-045,"This inexplicable incident, this reversal of my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the wall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began to reflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities of my double existence"
489,more,91,more,"That part of me which I had the power of projecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed to me of late as though the body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature, as though (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous tide of blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were much prolonged, the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown, the power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of Edward Hyde become irrevocably mine"
59,051-075,11,011-015,"The power of the drug had not been always equally displayed"
265,251-275,48,046-050,"Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed me; since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double, and once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and these rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment"
243,226-250,44,041-045,"Now, however, and in the light of that morning’s accident, I was led to remark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throw off the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly transferred itself to the other side"
165,151-175,29,026-030,"All things therefore seemed to point to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better self, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse"
45,051-075,10,009-010,"Between these two, I now felt I had to choose"
100,076-010,17,016-020,"My two natures had memory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared between them"
300,more,49,046-050,"Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitive apprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the pleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll, or but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in which he conceals himself from pursuit"
81,076-010,14,011-015,"Jekyll had more than a father’s interest; Hyde had more than a son’s indifference"
127,126-150,26,026-030,"To cast in my lot with Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly indulged and had of late begun to pamper"
138,126-150,26,026-030,"To cast it in with Hyde, was to die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a blow and forever, despised and friendless"
216,201-225,37,036-040,"The bargain might appear unequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for while Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde would be not even conscious of all that he had lost"
338,more,66,more,"Strange as my circumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace as man; much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any tempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with so vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was found wanting in the strength to keep to it"
270,251-275,43,041-045,"Yes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by friends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell to the liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses and secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Hyde"
180,176-200,32,031-035,"I made this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for I neither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edward Hyde, which still lay ready in my cabinet"
194,176-200,35,031-035,"For two months, however, I was true to my determination; for two months, I led a life of such severity as I had never before attained to, and enjoyed the compensations of an approving conscience"
319,more,57,056-060,"But time began at last to obliterate the freshness of my alarm; the praises of conscience began to grow into a thing of course; I began to be tortured with throes and longings, as of Hyde struggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour of moral weakness, I once again compounded and swallowed the transforming draught"
387,more,65,more,"I do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his vice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that he runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I, long as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the complete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which were the leading characters of Edward Hyde"
39,026-050,9,009-010,"Yet it was by these that I was punished"
49,051-075,10,009-010,"My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring"
100,076-010,19,016-020,"I was conscious, even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more furious propensity to ill"
369,more,69,more,"It must have been this, I suppose, that stirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to the civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God, no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything"
229,226-250,40,036-040,"But I had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness among temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was to fall"
50,051-075,10,009-010,"Instantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged"
245,226-250,46,046-050,"With a transport of glee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow; and it was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that I was suddenly, in the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a cold thrill of terror"
206,201-225,39,036-040,"A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit; and fled from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying and trembling, my lust of evil gratified and stimulated, my love of life screwed to the topmost peg"
320,more,57,056-060,"I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make assurance doubly sure) destroyed my papers; thence I set out through the lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on my crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet still hastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger"
100,076-010,21,021-025,"Hyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught, and as he drank it, pledged the dead man"
183,176-200,31,031-035,"The pangs of transformation had not done tearing him, before Henry Jekyll, with streaming tears of gratitude and remorse, had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped hands to God"
54,051-075,10,009-010,"The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot"
269,251-275,51,051-055,"I saw my life as a whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood, when I had walked with my father’s hand, and through the self-denying toils of my professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same sense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening"
239,226-250,43,041-045,"I could have screamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down the crowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed against me; and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniquity stared into my soul"
86,076-010,18,016-020,"As the acuteness of this remorse began to die away, it was succeeded by a sense of joy"
36,026-050,7,006-008,"The problem of my conduct was solved"
148,126-150,29,026-030,"Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I was now confined to the better part of my existence; and O, how I rejoiced to think of it"
75,076-010,12,011-015,"with what willing humility I embraced anew the restrictions of natural life"
120,101-125,24,021-025,"with what sincere renunciation I locked the door by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the key under my heel"
172,151-175,34,031-035,"The next day, came the news that the murder had not been overlooked, that the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was a man high in public estimation"
51,051-075,12,011-015,"It was not only a crime, it had been a tragic folly"
135,126-150,28,026-030,"I think I was glad to know it; I think I was glad to have my better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the scaffold"
129,126-150,28,026-030,"Jekyll was now my city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out an instant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him"
120,101-125,24,021-025,"I resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say with honesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good"
202,201-225,36,036-040,"You know yourself how earnestly, in the last months of the last year, I laboured to relieve suffering; you know that much was done for others, and that the days passed quietly, almost happily for myself"
321,more,61,more,"Nor can I truly say that I wearied of this beneficent and innocent life; I think instead that I daily enjoyed it more completely; but I was still cursed with my duality of purpose; and as the first edge of my penitence wore off, the lower side of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began to growl for licence"
272,251-275,53,051-055,"Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Hyde; the bare idea of that would startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own person that I was once more tempted to trifle with my conscience; and it was as an ordinary secret sinner that I at last fell before the assaults of temptation"
160,151-175,29,026-030,"There comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filled at last; and this brief condescension to my evil finally destroyed the balance of my soul"
112,101-125,23,021-025,"And yet I was not alarmed; the fall seemed natural, like a return to the old days before I had made my discovery"
183,176-200,32,031-035,"It was a fine, clear, January day, wet under foot where the frost had melted, but cloudless overhead; and the Regent’s Park was full of winter chirrupings and sweet with spring odours"
174,151-175,32,031-035,"I sat in the sun on a bench; the animal within me licking the chops of memory; the spiritual side a little drowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to begin"
170,151-175,29,026-030,"After all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours; and then I smiled, comparing myself with other men, comparing my active good-will with the lazy cruelty of their neglect"
121,101-125,22,021-025,"And at the very moment of that vainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the most deadly shuddering"
223,201-225,43,041-045,"These passed away, and left me faint; and then as in its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in the temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger, a solution of the bonds of obligation"
113,101-125,22,021-025,"I looked down; my clothes hung formlessly on my shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee was corded and hairy"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"I was once more Edward Hyde"
225,201-225,40,036-040,"A moment before I had been safe of all men’s respect, wealthy, beloved—the cloth laying for me in the dining-room at home; and now I was the common quarry of mankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows"
49,051-075,10,009-010,"My reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly"
247,226-250,43,041-045,"I have more than once observed that in my second character, my faculties seemed sharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it came about that, where Jekyll perhaps might have succumbed, Hyde rose to the importance of the moment"
74,076-010,17,016-020,"My drugs were in one of the presses of my cabinet; how was I to reach them"
81,076-010,16,016-020,"That was the problem that (crushing my temples in my hands) I set myself to solve"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"The laboratory door I had closed"
82,076-010,17,016-020,"If I sought to enter by the house, my own servants would consign me to the gallows"
55,051-075,11,011-015,"I saw I must employ another hand, and thought of Lanyon"
24,026-050,6,006-008,"How was he to be reached"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"how persuaded"
91,076-010,18,016-020,"Supposing that I escaped capture in the streets, how was I to make my way into his presence"
125,101-125,22,021-025,"and how should I, an unknown and displeasing visitor, prevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of his colleague, Dr"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Jekyll"
207,201-225,40,036-040,"Then I remembered that of my original character, one part remained to me: I could write my own hand; and once I had conceived that kindling spark, the way that I must follow became lighted up from end to end"
159,151-175,29,026-030,"Thereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning a passing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name of which I chanced to remember"
135,126-150,22,021-025,"At my appearance (which was indeed comical enough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could not conceal his mirth"
205,201-225,37,036-040,"I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of devilish fury; and the smile withered from his face—happily for him—yet more happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly dragged him from his perch"
243,226-250,46,046-050,"At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so black a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did they exchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to a private room, and brought me wherewithal to write"
137,126-150,26,026-030,"Hyde in danger of his life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain"
273,251-275,48,046-050,"Yet the creature was astute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will; composed his two important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and that he might receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out with directions that they should be registered"
316,more,60,056-060,"Thenceforward, he sat all day over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there he dined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing before his eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth in the corner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the streets of the city"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"He, I say—I cannot say, I"
78,076-010,15,011-015,"That child of Hell had nothing human; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred"
284,more,48,046-050,"And when at last, thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged the cab and ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an object marked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers, these two base passions raged within him like a tempest"
169,151-175,25,021-025,"He walked fast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking through the less frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided him from midnight"
61,051-075,13,011-015,"Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a box of lights"
38,026-050,9,009-010,"He smote her in the face, and she fled"
205,201-225,42,041-045,"When I came to myself at Lanyon’s, the horror of my old friend perhaps affected me somewhat: I do not know; it was at least but a drop in the sea to the abhorrence with which I looked back upon these hours"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"A change had come over me"
88,076-010,19,016-020,"It was no longer the fear of the gallows, it was the horror of being Hyde that racked me"
126,126-150,26,026-030,"I received Lanyon’s condemnation partly in a dream; it was partly in a dream that I came home to my own house and got into bed"
144,126-150,26,026-030,"I slept after the prostration of the day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the nightmares that wrung me could avail to break"
54,051-075,9,009-010,"I awoke in the morning shaken, weakened, but refreshed"
316,more,63,more,"I still hated and feared the thought of the brute that slept within me, and I had not of course forgotten the appalling dangers of the day before; but I was once more at home, in my own house and close to my drugs; and gratitude for my escape shone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness of hope"
317,more,56,056-060,"I was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking the chill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with those indescribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but the time to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again raging and freezing with the passions of Hyde"
71,076-010,15,011-015,"It took on this occasion a double dose to recall me to myself; and alas"
111,101-125,21,021-025,"six hours after, as I sat looking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be re-administered"
184,176-200,35,031-035,"In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a great effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation of the drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll"
182,176-200,38,036-040,"At all hours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory shudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair, it was always as Hyde that I awakened"
333,more,61,more,"Under the strain of this continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now condemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to man, I became, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever, languidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one thought: the horror of my other self"
340,more,60,056-060,"But when I slept, or when the virtue of the medicine wore off, I would leap almost without transition (for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into the possession of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling with causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough to contain the raging energies of life"
69,076-010,13,011-015,"The powers of Hyde seemed to have grown with the sickliness of Jekyll"
67,076-010,13,011-015,"And certainly the hate that now divided them was equal on each side"
45,051-075,9,009-010,"With Jekyll, it was a thing of vital instinct"
344,more,62,more,"He had now seen the full deformity of that creature that shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was co-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which in themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought of Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish but inorganic"
208,201-225,38,036-040,"This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the offices of life"
296,more,57,056-060,"And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to him closer than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh, where he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every hour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against him, and deposed him out of life"
54,051-075,11,011-015,"The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of a different order"
299,more,51,051-055,"His terror of the gallows drove him continually to commit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a part instead of a person; but he loathed the necessity, he loathed the despondency into which Jekyll was now fallen, and he resented the dislike with which he was himself regarded"
297,more,57,056-060,"Hence the ape-like tricks that he would play me, scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the pages of my books, burning the letters and destroying the portrait of my father; and indeed, had it not been for his fear of death, he would long ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin"
260,251-275,55,051-055,"But his love of life is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken and freeze at the mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and passion of this attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off by suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him"
416,more,72,more,"It is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this description; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice; and yet even to these, habit brought—no, not alleviation—but a certain callousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair; and my punishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity which has now fallen, and which has finally severed me from my own face and nature"
111,101-125,21,021-025,"My provision of the salt, which had never been renewed since the date of the first experiment, began to run low"
166,151-175,31,031-035,"I sent out for a fresh supply and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, and the first change of colour, not the second; I drank it and it was without efficiency"
203,201-225,39,036-040,"You will learn from Poole how I have had London ransacked; it was in vain; and I am now persuaded that my first supply was impure, and that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy to the draught"
113,101-125,22,021-025,"About a week has passed, and I am now finishing this statement under the influence of the last of the old powders"
137,126-150,27,026-030,"This, then, is the last time, short of a miracle, that Henry Jekyll can think his own thoughts or see his own face (now how sadly altered"
14,011-025,4,003-005,") in the glass"
177,176-200,34,031-035,"Nor must I delay too long to bring my writing to an end; for if my narrative has hitherto escaped destruction, it has been by a combination of great prudence and great good luck"
282,more,53,051-055,"Should the throes of change take me in the act of writing it, Hyde will tear it in pieces; but if some time shall have elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness and circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from the action of his ape-like spite"
82,076-010,16,016-020,"And indeed the doom that is closing on us both has already changed and crushed him"
310,more,57,056-060,"Half an hour from now, when I shall again and forever reindue that hated personality, I know how I shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair, or continue, with the most strained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening, to pace up and down this room (my last earthly refuge) and give ear to every sound of menace"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"Will Hyde die upon the scaffold"
61,051-075,12,011-015,"or will he find courage to release himself at the last moment"
107,101-125,21,021-025,"God knows; I am careless; this is my true hour of death, and what is to follow concerns another than myself"
126,126-150,27,026-030,"Here then, as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my confession, I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end"
25,026-050,7,006-008,"It is a sin to write this"
97,076-010,23,021-025,"It is a sin to think words no others think and to put them down upon a paper no others are to see"
19,011-025,5,003-005,"It is base and evil"
57,051-075,14,011-015,"It is as if we were speaking alone to no ears but our own"
81,076-010,16,016-020,"And we know well that there is no transgression blacker than to do or think alone"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"We have broken the laws"
79,076-010,16,016-020,"The laws say that men may not write unless the Council of Vocations bid them so"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"May we be forgiven"
36,026-050,9,009-010,"But this is not the only sin upon us"
70,076-010,14,011-015,"We have committed a greater crime, and for this crime there is no name"
146,126-150,31,031-035,"What punishment awaits us if it be discovered we know not, for no such crime has come in the memory of men and there are no laws to provide for it"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"It is dark here"
47,051-075,10,009-010,"The flame of the candle stands still in the air"
55,051-075,11,011-015,"Nothing moves in this tunnel save our hand on the paper"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"We are alone here under the earth"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"It is a fearful word, alone"
129,126-150,27,026-030,"The laws say that none among men may be alone, ever and at any time, for this is the great transgression and the root of all evil"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"But we have broken many laws"
165,151-175,35,031-035,"And now there is nothing here save our one body, and it is strange to see only two legs stretched on the ground, and on the wall before us the shadow of our one head"
107,101-125,19,016-020,"The walls are cracked and water runs upon them in thin threads without sound, black and glistening as blood"
70,076-010,14,011-015,"We stole the candle from the larder of the Home of the Street Sweepers"
92,076-010,17,016-020,"We shall be sentenced to ten years in the Palace of Corrective Detention if it be discovered"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"But this matters not"
127,126-150,27,026-030,"It matters only that the light is precious and we should not waste it to write when we need it for that work which is our crime"
70,076-010,12,011-015,"Nothing matters save the work, our secret, our evil, our precious work"
65,076-010,12,011-015,"Still, we must also write, for—may the Council have mercy upon us"
49,051-075,12,011-015,"—we wish to speak for once to no ears but our own"
131,126-150,26,026-030,"Our name is Equality 7-2521, as it is written on the iron bracelet which all men wear on their left wrists with their names upon it"
27,026-050,5,003-005,"We are twenty-one years old"
92,076-010,21,021-025,"We are six feet tall, and this is a burden, for there are not many men who are six feet tall"
74,076-010,14,011-015,"Ever have the Teachers and the Leaders pointed to us and frowned and said:"
105,101-125,19,016-020,"“There is evil in your bones, Equality 7-2521, for your body has grown beyond the bodies of your brothers"
45,051-075,10,009-010,"” But we cannot change our bones nor our body"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"We were born with a curse"
55,051-075,10,009-010,"It has always driven us to thoughts which are forbidden"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"It has always given us wishes which men may not wish"
78,076-010,19,016-020,"We know that we are evil, but there is no will in us and no power to resist it"
70,076-010,15,011-015,"This is our wonder and our secret fear, that we know and do not resist"
67,076-010,15,011-015,"We strive to be like all our brother men, for all men must be alike"
141,126-150,26,026-030,"Over the portals of the Palace of the World Council, there are words cut in the marble, which we repeat to ourselves whenever we are tempted:"
33,026-050,9,009-010,"“WE ARE ONE IN ALL AND ALL IN ONE"
39,026-050,9,009-010,"THERE ARE NO MEN BUT ONLY THE GREAT WE,"
28,026-050,4,003-005,"ONE, INDIVISIBLE AND FOREVER"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
48,051-075,10,009-010,"We repeat this to ourselves, but it helps us not"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"These words were cut long ago"
132,126-150,25,021-025,"There is green mould in the grooves of the letters and yellow streaks on the marble, which come from more years than men could count"
134,126-150,27,026-030,"And these words are the truth, for they are written on the Palace of the World Council, and the World Council is the body of all truth"
93,076-010,18,016-020,"Thus has it been ever since the Great Rebirth, and farther back than that no memory can reach"
137,126-150,25,021-025,"But we must never speak of the times before the Great Rebirth, else we are sentenced to three years in the Palace of Corrective Detention"
88,076-010,19,016-020,"It is only the Old Ones who whisper about it in the evenings, in the Home of the Useless"
191,176-200,33,031-035,"They whisper many strange things, of the towers which rose to the sky, in those Unmentionable Times, and of the wagons which moved without horses, and of the lights which burned without flame"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"But those times were evil"
153,151-175,32,031-035,"And those times passed away, when men saw the Great Truth which is this: that all men are one and that there is no will save the will of all men together"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"All men are good and wise"
67,076-010,14,011-015,"It is only we, Equality 7-2521, we alone who were born with a curse"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"For we are not like our brothers"
193,176-200,39,036-040,"And as we look back upon our life, we see that it has ever been thus and that it has brought us step by step to our last, supreme transgression, our crime of crimes hidden here under the ground"
157,151-175,32,031-035,"We remember the Home of the Infants where we lived till we were five years old, together with all the children of the City who had been born in the same year"
90,076-010,17,016-020,"The sleeping halls there were white and clean and bare of all things save one hundred beds"
100,076-010,18,016-020,"We were just like all our brothers then, save for the one transgression: we fought with our brothers"
103,101-125,19,016-020,"There are few offenses blacker than to fight with our brothers, at any age and for any cause whatsoever"
113,101-125,24,021-025,"The Council of the Home told us so, and of all the children of that year, we were locked in the cellar most often"
127,126-150,26,026-030,"When we were five years old, we were sent to the Home of the Students, where there are ten wards, for our ten years of learning"
51,051-075,9,009-010,"Men must learn till they reach their fifteenth year"
20,011-025,5,003-005,"Then they go to work"
115,101-125,26,026-030,"In the Home of the Students we arose when the big bell rang in the tower and we went to our beds when it rang again"
160,151-175,30,026-030,"Before we removed our garments, we stood in the great sleeping hall, and we raised our right arms, and we said all together with the three Teachers at the head:"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"“We are nothing"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"Mankind is all"
53,051-075,11,011-015,"By the grace of our brothers are we allowed our lives"
59,051-075,12,011-015,"We exist through, by and for our brothers who are the State"
4,000-010,1,000-002,"Amen"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"Then we slept"
84,076-010,16,016-020,"The sleeping halls were white and clean and bare of all things save one hundred beds"
78,076-010,15,011-015,"We, Equality 7-2521, were not happy in those years in the Home of the Students"
48,051-075,11,011-015,"It was not that the learning was too hard for us"
37,026-050,8,006-008,"It was that the learning was too easy"
62,076-010,15,011-015,"This is a great sin, to be born with a head which is too quick"
87,076-010,19,016-020,"It is not good to be different from our brothers, but it is evil to be superior to them"
66,076-010,13,011-015,"The Teachers told us so, and they frowned when they looked upon us"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"So we fought against this curse"
56,051-075,10,009-010,"We tried to forget our lessons, but we always remembered"
111,101-125,19,016-020,"We tried not to understand what the Teachers taught, but we always understood it before the Teachers had spoken"
206,201-225,43,041-045,"We looked upon Union 5-3992, who were a pale boy with only half a brain, and we tried to say and do as they did, that we might be like them, like Union 5-3992, but somehow the Teachers knew that we were not"
57,051-075,11,011-015,"And we were lashed more often than all the other children"
149,126-150,29,026-030,"The Teachers were just, for they had been appointed by the Councils, and the Councils are the voice of all justice, for they are the voice of all men"
154,151-175,29,026-030,"And if sometimes, in the secret darkness of our heart, we regret that which befell us on our fifteenth birthday, we know that it was through our own guilt"
74,076-010,17,016-020,"We had broken a law, for we had not paid heed to the words of our Teachers"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"The Teachers had said to us all:"
100,076-010,21,021-025,"“Dare not choose in your minds the work you would like to do when you leave the Home of the Students"
72,076-010,13,011-015,"You shall do that which the Council of Vocations shall prescribe for you"
154,151-175,29,026-030,"For the Council of Vocations knows in its great wisdom where you are needed by your brother men, better than you can know it in your unworthy little minds"
110,101-125,23,021-025,"And if you are not needed by your brother man, there is no reason for you to burden the earth with your bodies"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
78,076-010,16,016-020,"We knew this well, in the years of our childhood, but our curse broke our will"
94,076-010,17,016-020,"We were guilty and we confess it here: we were guilty of the great Transgression of Preference"
53,051-075,10,009-010,"We preferred some work and some lessons to the others"
89,076-010,17,016-020,"We did not listen well to the history of all the Councils elected since the Great Rebirth"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"But we loved the Science of Things"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"We wished to know"
69,076-010,14,011-015,"We wished to know about all the things which make the earth around us"
55,051-075,10,009-010,"We asked so many questions that the Teachers forbade it"
93,076-010,19,016-020,"We think that there are mysteries in the sky and under the water and in the plants which grow"
110,101-125,20,016-020,"But the Council of Scholars has said that there are no mysteries, and the Council of Scholars knows all things"
37,026-050,7,006-008,"And we learned much from our Teachers"
105,101-125,21,021-025,"We learned that the earth is flat and that the sun revolves around it, which causes the day and the night"
100,076-010,21,021-025,"We learned the names of all the winds which blow over the seas and push the sails of our great ships"
56,051-075,12,011-015,"We learned how to bleed men to cure them of all ailments"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"We loved the Science of Things"
386,more,78,more,"And in the darkness, in the secret hour, when we awoke in the night and there were no brothers around us, but only their shapes in the beds and their snores, we closed our eyes, and we held our lips shut, and we stopped our breath, that no shudder might let our brothers see or hear or guess, and we thought that we wished to be sent to the Home of the Scholars when our time would come"
258,251-275,51,051-055,"All the great modern inventions come from the Home of the Scholars, such as the newest one, which was found only a hundred years ago, of how to make candles from wax and string; also, how to make glass, which is put in our windows to protect us from the rain"
127,126-150,24,021-025,"To find these things, the Scholars must study the earth and learn from the rivers, from the sands, from the winds and the rocks"
74,076-010,16,016-020,"And if we went to the Home of the Scholars, we could learn from these also"
65,076-010,12,011-015,"We could ask questions of these, for they do not forbid questions"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"And questions give us no rest"
71,076-010,16,016-020,"We know not why our curse makes us seek we know not what, ever and ever"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"But we cannot resist it"
132,126-150,29,026-030,"It whispers to us that there are great things on this earth of ours, and that we can know them if we try, and that we must know them"
57,051-075,14,011-015,"We ask, why must we know, but it has no answer to give us"
29,026-050,7,006-008,"We must know that we may know"
51,051-075,12,011-015,"So we wished to be sent to the Home of the Scholars"
146,126-150,30,026-030,"We wished it so much that our hands trembled under the blankets in the night, and we bit our arm to stop that other pain which we could not endure"
61,051-075,13,011-015,"It was evil and we dared not face our brothers in the morning"
39,026-050,7,006-008,"For men may wish nothing for themselves"
184,176-200,36,036-040,"And we were punished when the Council of Vocations came to give us our life Mandates which tell those who reach their fifteenth year what their work is to be for the rest of their days"
88,076-010,18,016-020,"The Council of Vocations came on the first day of spring, and they sat in the great hall"
69,076-010,14,011-015,"And we who were fifteen and all the Teachers came into the great hall"
108,101-125,23,021-025,"And the Council of Vocations sat on a high dais, and they had but two words to speak to each of the Students"
157,151-175,25,021-025,"They called the Students’ names, and when the Students stepped before them, one after another, the Council said: “Carpenter” or “Doctor” or “Cook” or “Leader"
86,076-010,17,016-020,"” Then each Student raised their right arm and said: “The will of our brothers be done"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
120,101-125,23,021-025,"Now if the Council has said “Carpenter” or “Cook,” the Students so assigned go to work and they do not study any further"
156,151-175,30,026-030,"But if the Council has said “Leader,” then those Students go into the Home of the Leaders, which is the greatest house in the City, for it has three stories"
188,176-200,36,036-040,"And there they study for many years, so that they may become candidates and be elected to the City Council and the State Council and the World Council—by a free and general vote of all men"
65,076-010,15,011-015,"But we wished not to be a Leader, even though it is a great honor"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"We wished to be a Scholar"
115,101-125,22,021-025,"So we awaited our turn in the great hall and then we heard the Council of Vocations call our name: “Equality 7-2521"
86,076-010,19,016-020,"” We walked to the dais, and our legs did not tremble, and we looked up at the Council"
86,076-010,17,016-020,"There were five members of the Council, three of the male gender and two of the female"
80,076-010,17,016-020,"Their hair was white and their faces were cracked as the clay of a dry river bed"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"They were old"
68,076-010,13,011-015,"They seemed older than the marble of the Temple of the World Council"
40,026-050,9,009-010,"They sat before us and they did not move"
59,051-075,13,011-015,"And we saw no breath to stir the folds of their white togas"
113,101-125,24,021-025,"But we knew that they were alive, for a finger of the hand of the oldest rose, pointed to us, and fell down again"
106,101-125,21,021-025,"This was the only thing which moved, for the lips of the oldest did not move as they said: “Street Sweeper"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
121,101-125,26,026-030,"We felt the cords of our neck grow tight as our head rose higher to look upon the faces of the Council, and we were happy"
64,076-010,16,016-020,"We knew we had been guilty, but now we had a way to atone for it"
169,151-175,32,031-035,"We would accept our Life Mandate, and we would work for our brothers, gladly and willingly, and we would erase our sin against them, which they did not know, but we knew"
74,076-010,14,011-015,"So we were happy, and proud of ourselves and of our victory over ourselves"
124,101-125,25,021-025,"We raised our right arm and we spoke, and our voice was the clearest, the steadiest voice in the hall that day, and we said:"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"“The will of our brothers be done"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
99,076-010,19,016-020,"And we looked straight into the eyes of the Council, but their eyes were as cold blue glass buttons"
47,051-075,10,009-010,"So we went into the Home of the Street Sweepers"
37,026-050,9,009-010,"It is a grey house on a narrow street"
125,101-125,27,026-030,"There is a sundial in its courtyard, by which the Council of the Home can tell the hours of the day and when to ring the bell"
47,051-075,10,009-010,"When the bell rings, we all arise from our beds"
52,051-075,12,011-015,"The sky is green and cold in our windows to the east"
196,176-200,37,036-040,"The shadow on the sundial marks off a half-hour while we dress and eat our breakfast in the dining hall, where there are five long tables with twenty clay plates and twenty clay cups on each table"
76,076-010,17,016-020,"Then we go to work in the streets of the City, with our brooms and our rakes"
121,101-125,25,021-025,"In five hours, when the sun is high, we return to the Home and we eat our midday meal, for which one-half hour is allowed"
24,026-050,6,006-008,"Then we go to work again"
116,101-125,23,021-025,"In five hours, the shadows are blue on the pavements, and the sky is blue with a deep brightness which is not bright"
53,051-075,11,011-015,"We come back to have our dinner, which lasts one hour"
101,101-125,21,021-025,"Then the bell rings and we walk in a straight column to one of the City Halls, for the Social Meeting"
66,076-010,12,011-015,"Other columns of men arrive from the Homes of the different Trades"
137,126-150,28,026-030,"The candles are lit, and the Councils of the different Homes stand in a pulpit, and they speak to us of our duties and of our brother men"
179,176-200,34,031-035,"Then visiting Leaders mount the pulpit and they read to us the speeches which were made in the City Council that day, for the City Council represents all men and all men must know"
108,101-125,20,016-020,"Then we sing hymns, the Hymn of Brotherhood, and the Hymn of Equality, and the Hymn of the Collective Spirit"
52,051-075,12,011-015,"The sky is a soggy purple when we return to the Home"
109,101-125,21,021-025,"Then the bell rings and we walk in a straight column to the City Theatre for three hours of Social Recreation"
147,126-150,28,026-030,"There a play is shown upon the stage, with two great choruses from the Home of the Actors, which speak and answer all together, in two great voices"
43,051-075,10,009-010,"The plays are about toil and how good it is"
50,051-075,11,011-015,"Then we walk back to the Home in a straight column"
90,076-010,17,016-020,"The sky is like a black sieve pierced by silver drops that tremble, ready to burst through"
42,051-075,7,006-008,"The moths beat against the street lanterns"
57,051-075,13,011-015,"We go to our beds and we sleep, till the bell rings again"
83,076-010,16,016-020,"The sleeping halls are white and clean and bare of all things save one hundred beds"
88,076-010,17,016-020,"Thus have we lived each day of four years, until two springs ago when our crime happened"
43,051-075,9,009-010,"Thus must all men live until they are forty"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"At forty, they are worn out"
75,076-010,16,016-020,"At forty, they are sent to the Home of the Useless, where the Old Ones live"
58,051-075,13,011-015,"The Old Ones do not work, for the State takes care of them"
64,076-010,15,011-015,"They sit in the sun in summer and they sit by the fire in winter"
43,051-075,9,009-010,"They do not speak often, for they are weary"
43,051-075,10,009-010,"The Old Ones know that they are soon to die"
152,151-175,29,026-030,"When a miracle happens and some live to be forty-five, they are the Ancient Ones, and the children stare at them when passing by the Home of the Useless"
90,076-010,20,016-020,"Such is to be our life, as that of all our brothers and of the brothers who came before us"
93,076-010,18,016-020,"Such would have been our life, had we not committed our crime which changed all things for us"
48,051-075,11,011-015,"And it was our curse which drove us to our crime"
108,101-125,21,021-025,"We had been a good Street Sweeper and like all our brother Street Sweepers, save for our cursed wish to know"
72,076-010,16,016-020,"We looked too long at the stars at night, and at the trees and the earth"
148,126-150,28,026-030,"And when we cleaned the yard of the Home of the Scholars, we gathered the glass vials, the pieces of metal, the dried bones which they had discarded"
82,076-010,18,016-020,"We wished to keep these things and to study them, but we had no place to hide them"
39,026-050,8,006-008,"So we carried them to the City Cesspool"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"And then we made the discovery"
41,051-075,10,009-010,"It was on a day of the spring before last"
130,126-150,22,021-025,"We Street Sweepers work in brigades of three, and we were with Union 5-3992, they of the half-brain, and with International 4-8818"
133,126-150,23,021-025,"Now Union 5-3992 are a sickly lad and sometimes they are stricken with convulsions, when their mouth froths and their eyes turn white"
38,026-050,5,003-005,"But International 4-8818 are different"
100,076-010,19,016-020,"They are a tall, strong youth and their eyes are like fireflies, for there is laughter in their eyes"
64,076-010,11,011-015,"We cannot look upon International 4-8818 and not smile in answer"
101,101-125,21,021-025,"For this they were not liked in the Home of the Students, as it is not proper to smile without reason"
144,126-150,27,026-030,"And also they were not liked because they took pieces of coal and they drew pictures upon the walls, and they were pictures which made men laugh"
175,151-175,32,031-035,"But it is only our brothers in the Home of the Artists who are permitted to draw pictures, so International 4-8818 were sent to the Home of the Street Sweepers, like ourselves"
39,026-050,6,006-008,"International 4-8818 and we are friends"
196,176-200,38,036-040,"This is an evil thing to say, for it is a transgression, the great Transgression of Preference, to love any among men better than the others, since we must love all men and all men are our friends"
54,051-075,10,009-010,"So International 4-8818 and we have never spoken of it"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"But we know"
44,051-075,9,009-010,"We know, when we look into each other’s eyes"
142,126-150,26,026-030,"And when we look thus without words, we both know other things also, strange things for which there are no words, and these things frighten us"
132,126-150,25,021-025,"So on that day of the spring before last, Union 5-3992 were stricken with convulsions on the edge of the City, near the City Theatre"
109,101-125,22,021-025,"We left them to lie in the shade of the Theatre tent and we went with International 4-8818 to finish our work"
55,051-075,10,009-010,"We came together to the great ravine behind the Theatre"
36,026-050,8,006-008,"It is empty save for trees and weeds"
120,101-125,22,021-025,"Beyond the ravine there is a plain, and beyond the plain there lies the Uncharted Forest, about which men must not think"
124,101-125,25,021-025,"We were gathering the papers and the rags which the wind had blown from the Theatre, when we saw an iron bar among the weeds"
35,026-050,8,006-008,"It was old and rusted by many rains"
57,051-075,12,011-015,"We pulled with all our strength, but we could not move it"
83,076-010,14,011-015,"So we called International 4-8818, and together we scraped the earth around the bar"
87,076-010,20,016-020,"Of a sudden the earth fell in before us, and we saw an old iron grill over a black hole"
33,026-050,4,003-005,"International 4-8818 stepped back"
42,051-075,10,009-010,"But we pulled at the grill and it gave way"
87,076-010,17,016-020,"And then we saw iron rings as steps leading down a shaft into a darkness without bottom"
51,051-075,9,009-010,"“We shall go down,” we said to International 4-8818"
32,026-050,5,003-005,"“It is forbidden,” they answered"
75,076-010,15,011-015,"We said: “The Council does not know of this hole, so it cannot be forbidden"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
108,101-125,21,021-025,"And they answered: “Since the Council does not know of this hole, there can be no law permitting to enter it"
57,051-075,10,009-010,"And everything which is not permitted by law is forbidden"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
40,026-050,9,009-010,"But we said: “We shall go, none the less"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
57,051-075,11,011-015,"They were frightened, but they stood by and watched us go"
53,051-075,12,011-015,"We hung on the iron rings with our hands and our feet"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"We could see nothing below us"
105,101-125,23,021-025,"And above us the hole open upon the sky grew smaller and smaller, till it came to be the size of a button"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"But still we went down"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"Then our foot touched the ground"
40,026-050,9,009-010,"We rubbed our eyes, for we could not see"
79,076-010,16,016-020,"Then our eyes became used to the darkness, but we could not believe what we saw"
130,126-150,28,026-030,"No men known to us could have built this place, nor the men known to our brothers who lived before us, and yet it was built by men"
21,011-025,5,003-005,"It was a great tunnel"
85,076-010,18,016-020,"Its walls were hard and smooth to the touch; it felt like stone, but it was not stone"
104,101-125,22,021-025,"On the ground there were long thin tracks of iron, but it was not iron; it felt smooth and cold as glass"
97,076-010,19,016-020,"We knelt, and we crawled forward, our hand groping along the iron line to see where it would lead"
37,026-050,7,006-008,"But there was an unbroken night ahead"
80,076-010,14,011-015,"Only the iron tracks glowed through it, straight and white, calling us to follow"
73,076-010,15,011-015,"But we could not follow, for we were losing the puddle of light behind us"
59,051-075,13,011-015,"So we turned and we crawled back, our hand on the iron line"
52,051-075,9,009-010,"And our heart beat in our fingertips, without reason"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"And then we knew"
70,076-010,12,011-015,"We knew suddenly that this place was left from the Unmentionable Times"
76,076-010,16,016-020,"So it was true, and those Times had been, and all the wonders of those Times"
71,076-010,13,011-015,"Hundreds upon hundreds of years ago men knew secrets which we have lost"
37,026-050,8,006-008,"And we thought: “This is a foul place"
63,076-010,11,011-015,"They are damned who touch the things of the Unmentionable Times"
209,201-225,43,041-045,"” But our hand which followed the track, as we crawled, clung to the iron as if it would not leave it, as if the skin of our hand were thirsty and begging of the metal some secret fluid beating in its coldness"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"We returned to the earth"
52,051-075,8,006-008,"International 4-8818 looked upon us and stepped back"
49,051-075,8,006-008,"“Equality 7-2521,” they said, “your face is white"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
53,051-075,11,011-015,"But we could not speak and we stood looking upon them"
47,051-075,10,009-010,"They backed away, as if they dared not touch us"
70,076-010,15,011-015,"Then they smiled, but it was not a gay smile; it was lost and pleading"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"But still we could not speak"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"Then they said:"
77,076-010,16,016-020,"“We shall report our find to the City Council and both of us will be rewarded"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"And then we spoke"
54,051-075,12,011-015,"Our voice was hard and there was no mercy in our voice"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"We said:"
49,051-075,10,009-010,"“We shall not report our find to the City Council"
33,026-050,8,006-008,"We shall not report it to any men"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
83,076-010,16,016-020,"They raised their hands to their ears, for never had they heard such words as these"
112,101-125,20,016-020,"“International 4-8818,” we asked, “will you report us to the Council and see us lashed to death before your eyes"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
75,076-010,14,011-015,"They stood straight all of a sudden and they answered: “Rather would we die"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
29,026-050,5,003-005,"“Then,” we said, “keep silent"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"This place is ours"
71,076-010,14,011-015,"This place belongs to us, Equality 7-2521, and to no other men on earth"
69,076-010,14,011-015,"And if ever we surrender it, we shall surrender our life with it also"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
102,101-125,20,016-020,"Then we saw that the eyes of International 4-8818 were full to the lids with tears they dared not drop"
77,076-010,13,011-015,"They whispered, and their voice trembled, so that their words lost all shape:"
95,076-010,20,016-020,"“The will of the Council is above all things, for it is the will of our brothers, which is holy"
40,026-050,10,009-010,"But if you wish it so, we shall obey you"
64,076-010,13,011-015,"Rather shall we be evil with you than good with all our brothers"
47,051-075,9,009-010,"May the Council have mercy upon both our hearts"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
72,076-010,14,011-015,"Then we walked away together and back to the Home of the Street Sweepers"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"And we walked in silence"
187,176-200,36,036-040,"Thus did it come to pass that each night, when the stars are high and the Street Sweepers sit in the City Theatre, we, Equality 7-2521, steal out and run through the darkness to our place"
177,176-200,38,036-040,"It is easy to leave the Theatre; when the candles are blown out and the Actors come onto the stage, no eyes can see us as we crawl under our seat and under the cloth of the tent"
126,126-150,23,021-025,"Later, it is easy to steal through the shadows and fall in line next to International 4-8818, as the column leaves the Theatre"
130,126-150,28,026-030,"It is dark in the streets and there are no men about, for no men may walk through the City when they have no mission to walk there"
122,101-125,26,026-030,"Each night, we run to the ravine, and we remove the stones which we have piled upon the iron grill to hide it from the men"
58,051-075,11,011-015,"Each night, for three hours, we are under the earth, alone"
143,126-150,27,026-030,"We have stolen candles from the Home of the Street Sweepers, we have stolen flints and knives and paper, and we have brought them to this place"
78,076-010,15,011-015,"We have stolen glass vials and powders and acids from the Home of the Scholars"
64,076-010,14,011-015,"Now we sit in the tunnel for three hours each night and we study"
118,101-125,24,021-025,"We melt strange metals, and we mix acids, and we cut open the bodies of the animals which we find in the City Cesspool"
62,076-010,13,011-015,"We have built an oven of the bricks we gathered in the streets"
38,026-050,9,009-010,"We burn the wood we find in the ravine"
111,101-125,23,021-025,"The fire flickers in the oven and blue shadows dance upon the walls, and there is no sound of men to disturb us"
26,026-050,4,003-005,"We have stolen manuscripts"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"This is a great offense"
136,126-150,24,021-025,"Manuscripts are precious, for our brothers in the Home of the Clerks spend one year to copy one single script in their clear handwriting"
66,076-010,13,011-015,"Manuscripts are rare and they are kept in the Home of the Scholars"
56,051-075,12,011-015,"So we sit under the earth and we read the stolen scripts"
47,051-075,9,009-010,"Two years have passed since we found this place"
108,101-125,23,021-025,"And in these two years we have learned more than we had learned in the ten years of the Home of the Students"
51,051-075,10,009-010,"We have learned things which are not in the scripts"
62,076-010,11,011-015,"We have solved secrets of which the Scholars have no knowledge"
109,101-125,23,021-025,"We have come to see how great is the unexplored, and many lifetimes will not bring us to the end of our quest"
31,026-050,8,006-008,"But we wish no end to our quest"
156,151-175,31,031-035,"We wish nothing, save to be alone and to learn, and to feel as if with each day our sight were growing sharper than the hawk’s and clearer than rock crystal"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"Strange are the ways of evil"
41,051-075,9,009-010,"We are false in the faces of our brothers"
39,026-050,8,006-008,"We are defying the will of our Councils"
134,126-150,29,026-030,"We alone, of the thousands who walk this earth, we alone in this hour are doing a work which has no purpose save that we wish to do it"
56,051-075,13,011-015,"The evil of our crime is not for the human mind to probe"
87,076-010,17,016-020,"The nature of our punishment, if it be discovered, is not for the human heart to ponder"
99,076-010,19,016-020,"Never, not in the memory of the Ancient Ones’ Ancients, never have men done that which we are doing"
45,051-075,11,011-015,"And yet there is no shame in us and no regret"
54,051-075,12,011-015,"We say to ourselves that we are a wretch and a traitor"
62,076-010,14,011-015,"But we feel no burden upon our spirit and no fear in our heart"
95,076-010,22,021-025,"And it seems to us that our spirit is clear as a lake troubled by no eyes save those of the sun"
45,051-075,9,009-010,"And in our heart—strange are the ways of evil"
68,076-010,14,011-015,"—in our heart there is the first peace we have known in twenty years"
14,011-025,2,000-002,"Liberty 5-3000"
27,026-050,3,003-005,"Liberty five-three thousand"
14,011-025,2,000-002,"Liberty 5-3000"
26,026-050,6,006-008,"We wish to write this name"
61,051-075,14,011-015,"We wish to speak it, but we dare not speak it above a whisper"
92,076-010,18,016-020,"For men are forbidden to take notice of women, and women are forbidden to take notice of men"
93,076-010,19,016-020,"But we think of one among women, they whose name is Liberty 5-3000, and we think of no others"
99,076-010,20,016-020,"The women who have been assigned to work the soil live in the Homes of the Peasants beyond the City"
138,126-150,27,026-030,"Where the City ends there is a great road winding off to the north, and we Street Sweepers must keep this road clean to the first milepost"
68,076-010,14,011-015,"There is a hedge along the road, and beyond the hedge lie the fields"
264,251-275,47,046-050,"The fields are black and ploughed, and they lie like a great fan before us, with their furrows gathered in some hand beyond the sky, spreading forth from that hand, opening wide apart as they come toward us, like black pleats that sparkle with thin, green spangles"
120,101-125,23,021-025,"Women work in the fields, and their white tunics in the wind are like the wings of sea-gulls beating over the black soil"
69,076-010,13,011-015,"And there it was that we saw Liberty 5-3000 walking along the furrows"
51,051-075,11,011-015,"Their body was straight and thin as a blade of iron"
89,076-010,18,016-020,"Their eyes were dark and hard and glowing, with no fear in them, no kindness and no guilt"
115,101-125,24,021-025,"Their hair was golden as the sun; their hair flew in the wind, shining and wild, as if it defied men to restrain it"
121,101-125,24,021-025,"They threw seeds from their hand as if they deigned to fling a scornful gift, and the earth was a beggar under their feet"
66,076-010,14,011-015,"We stood still; for the first time did we know fear, and then pain"
80,076-010,15,011-015,"And we stood still that we might not spill this pain more precious than pleasure"
104,101-125,19,016-020,"Then we heard a voice from the others call their name: “Liberty 5-3000,” and they turned and walked back"
107,101-125,21,021-025,"Thus we learned their name, and we stood watching them go, till their white tunic was lost in the blue mist"
105,101-125,21,021-025,"And the following day, as we came to the northern road, we kept our eyes upon Liberty 5-3000 in the field"
88,076-010,17,016-020,"And each day thereafter we knew the illness of waiting for our hour on the northern road"
46,051-075,9,009-010,"And there we looked at Liberty 5-3000 each day"
65,076-010,14,011-015,"We know not whether they looked at us also, but we think they did"
73,076-010,15,011-015,"Then one day they came close to the hedge, and suddenly they turned to us"
111,101-125,22,021-025,"They turned in a whirl and the movement of their body stopped, as if slashed off, as suddenly as it had started"
85,076-010,16,016-020,"They stood still as a stone, and they looked straight upon us, straight into our eyes"
48,051-075,10,009-010,"There was no smile on their face, and no welcome"
49,051-075,10,009-010,"But their face was taut, and their eyes were dark"
57,051-075,11,011-015,"Then they turned as swiftly, and they walked away from us"
60,051-075,12,011-015,"But the following day, when we came to the road, they smiled"
28,026-050,7,006-008,"They smiled to us and for us"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"And we smiled in answer"
131,126-150,24,021-025,"Their head fell back, and their arms fell, as if their arms and their thin white neck were stricken suddenly with a great lassitude"
47,051-075,10,009-010,"They were not looking upon us, but upon the sky"
132,126-150,27,026-030,"Then they glanced at us over their shoulder, as we felt as if a hand had touched our body, slipping softly from our lips to our feet"
61,051-075,10,009-010,"Every morning thereafter, we greeted each other with our eyes"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"We dared not speak"
92,076-010,18,016-020,"It is a transgression to speak to men of other Trades, save in groups at the Social Meetings"
126,126-150,23,021-025,"But once, standing at the hedge, we raised our hand to our forehead and then moved it slowly, palm down, toward Liberty 5-3000"
119,101-125,24,021-025,"Had the others seen it, they could have guessed nothing, for it looked only as if we were shading our eyes from the sun"
40,026-050,7,006-008,"But Liberty 5-3000 saw it and understood"
63,076-010,13,011-015,"They raised their hand to their forehead and moved it as we had"
80,076-010,15,011-015,"Thus, each day, we greet Liberty 5-3000, and they answer, and no men can suspect"
40,026-050,10,009-010,"We do not wonder at this new sin of ours"
148,126-150,29,026-030,"It is our second Transgression of Preference, for we do not think of all our brothers, as we must, but only of one, and their name is Liberty 5-3000"
35,026-050,9,009-010,"We do not know why we think of them"
125,101-125,30,026-030,"We do not know why, when we think of them, we feel all of a sudden that the earth is good and that it is not a burden to live"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"We do not think of them as Liberty 5-3000 any longer"
41,051-075,9,009-010,"We have given them a name in our thoughts"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"We call them the Golden One"
71,076-010,15,011-015,"But it is a sin to give men names which distinguish them from other men"
65,076-010,14,011-015,"Yet we call them the Golden One, for they are not like the others"
38,026-050,8,006-008,"The Golden One are not like the others"
101,101-125,23,021-025,"And we take no heed of the law which says that men may not think of women, save at the Time of Mating"
153,151-175,31,031-035,"This is the time each spring when all the men older than twenty and all the women older than eighteen are sent for one night to the City Palace of Mating"
85,076-010,18,016-020,"And each of the men have one of the women assigned to them by the Council of Eugenics"
103,101-125,17,016-020,"Children are born each winter, but women never see their children and children never know their parents"
120,101-125,26,026-030,"Twice have we been sent to the Palace of Mating, but it is an ugly and shameful matter, of which we do not like to think"
61,051-075,13,011-015,"We had broken so many laws, and today we have broken one more"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"Today, we spoke to the Golden One"
95,076-010,21,021-025,"The other women were far off in the field, when we stopped at the hedge by the side of the road"
75,076-010,14,011-015,"The Golden One were kneeling alone at the moat which runs through the field"
124,101-125,25,021-025,"And the drops of water falling from their hands, as they raised the water to their lips, were like sparks of fire in the sun"
254,251-275,51,051-055,"Then the Golden One saw us, and they did not move, kneeling there, looking at us, and circles of light played upon their white tunic, from the sun on the water of the moat, and one sparkling drop fell from a finger of their hand held as frozen in the air"
92,076-010,20,016-020,"Then the Golden One rose and walked to the hedge, as if they had heard a command in our eyes"
84,076-010,16,016-020,"The two other Street Sweepers of our brigade were a hundred paces away down the road"
99,076-010,16,016-020,"And we thought that International 4-8818 would not betray us, and Union 5-3992 would not understand"
139,126-150,28,026-030,"So we looked straight upon the Golden One, and we saw the shadows of their lashes on their white cheeks and the sparks of sun on their lips"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"And we said:"
34,026-050,5,003-005,"“You are beautiful, Liberty 5-3000"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
57,051-075,12,011-015,"Their face did not move and they did not avert their eyes"
131,126-150,26,026-030,"Only their eyes grew wider, and there was triumph in their eyes, and it was not triumph over us, but over things we could not guess"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"Then they asked:"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"“What is your name"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
30,026-050,4,003-005,"“Equality 7-2521,” we answered"
79,076-010,17,016-020,"“You are not one of our brothers, Equality 7-2521, for we do not wish you to be"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
121,101-125,25,021-025,"We cannot say what they meant, for there are no words for their meaning, but we know it without words and we knew it then"
50,051-075,10,009-010,"“No,” we answered, “nor are you one of our sisters"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
59,051-075,13,011-015,"“If you see us among scores of women, will you look upon us"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
87,076-010,18,016-020,"“We shall look upon you, Liberty 5-3000, if we see you among all the women of the earth"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"Then they asked:"
98,076-010,19,016-020,"“Are Street Sweepers sent to different parts of the City or do they always work in the same places"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
96,076-010,19,016-020,"“They always work in the same places,” we answered, “and no one will take this road away from us"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
63,076-010,13,011-015,"“Your eyes,” they said, “are not like the eyes of any among men"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
95,076-010,18,016-020,"And suddenly, without cause for the thought which came to us, we felt cold, cold to our stomach"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"“How old are you"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"” we asked"
75,076-010,13,011-015,"They understood our thought, for they lowered their eyes for the first time"
27,026-050,3,003-005,"“Seventeen,” they whispered"
117,101-125,24,021-025,"And we sighed, as if a burden had been taken from us, for we had been thinking without reason of the Palace of Mating"
73,076-010,16,016-020,"And we thought that we would not let the Golden One be sent to the Palace"
103,101-125,22,021-025,"How to prevent it, how to bar the will of the Councils, we knew not, but we knew suddenly that we would"
113,101-125,24,021-025,"Only we do not know why such thought came to us, for these ugly matters bear no relation to us and the Golden One"
27,026-050,5,003-005,"What relation can they bear"
136,126-150,26,026-030,"Still, without reason, as we stood there by the hedge, we felt our lips drawn tight with hatred, a sudden hatred for all our brother men"
111,101-125,23,021-025,"And the Golden One saw it and smiled slowly, and there was in their smile the first sadness we had seen in them"
94,076-010,18,016-020,"We think that in the wisdom of women the Golden One had understood more than we can understand"
110,101-125,21,021-025,"Then three of the sisters in the field appeared, coming toward the road, so the Golden One walked away from us"
98,076-010,20,016-020,"They took the bag of seeds, and they threw the seeds into the furrows of earth as they walked away"
71,076-010,14,011-015,"But the seeds flew wildly, for the hand of the Golden One was trembling"
104,101-125,21,021-025,"Yet as we walked back to the Home of the Street Sweepers, we felt that we wanted to sing, without reason"
130,126-150,25,021-025,"So we were reprimanded tonight, in the dining hall, for without knowing it we had begun to sing aloud some tune we had never heard"
72,076-010,14,011-015,"But it is not proper to sing without reason, save at the Social Meetings"
97,076-010,18,016-020,"“We are singing because we are happy,” we answered the one of the Home Council who reprimanded us"
37,026-050,6,006-008,"“Indeed you are happy,” they answered"
54,051-075,11,011-015,"“How else can men be when they live for their brothers"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
64,076-010,12,011-015,"And now, sitting here in our tunnel, we wonder about these words"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"It is forbidden, not to be happy"
202,201-225,44,041-045,"For, as it has been explained to us, men are free and the earth belongs to them; and all things on earth belong to all men; and the will of all men together is good for all; and so all men must be happy"
116,101-125,23,021-025,"Yet as we stand at night in the great hall, removing our garments for sleep, we look upon our brothers and we wonder"
35,026-050,7,006-008,"The heads of our brothers are bowed"
81,076-010,17,016-020,"The eyes of our brothers are dull, and never do they look one another in the eyes"
139,126-150,25,021-025,"The shoulders of our brothers are hunched, and their muscles are drawn, as if their bodies were shrinking and wished to shrink out of sight"
84,076-010,18,016-020,"And a word steals into our mind, as we look upon our brothers, and that word is fear"
85,076-010,18,016-020,"There is fear hanging in the air of the sleeping halls, and in the air of the streets"
61,051-075,10,009-010,"Fear walks through the City, fear without name, without shape"
38,026-050,9,009-010,"All men feel it and none dare to speak"
63,076-010,14,011-015,"We feel it also, when we are in the Home of the Street Sweepers"
45,051-075,10,009-010,"But here, in our tunnel, we feel it no longer"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"The air is pure under the ground"
23,026-050,6,006-008,"There is no odor of men"
69,076-010,13,011-015,"And these three hours give us strength for our hours above the ground"
82,076-010,16,016-020,"Our body is betraying us, for the Council of the Home looks with suspicion upon us"
70,076-010,17,016-020,"It is not good to feel too much joy nor to be glad that our body lives"
109,101-125,25,021-025,"For we matter not and it must not matter to us whether we live or die, which is to be as our brothers will it"
46,051-075,9,009-010,"But we, Equality 7-2521, are glad to be living"
41,051-075,10,009-010,"If this is a vice, then we wish no virtue"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"Yet our brothers are not like us"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"All is not well with our brothers"
178,176-200,32,031-035,"There are Fraternity 2-5503, a quiet boy with wise, kind eyes, who cry suddenly, without reason, in the midst of day or night, and their body shakes with sobs they cannot explain"
135,126-150,25,021-025,"There are Solidarity 9-6347, who are a bright youth, without fear in the day; but they scream in their sleep, and they scream: “Help us"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"Help us"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"Help us"
98,076-010,18,016-020,"” into the night, in a voice which chills our bones, but the Doctors cannot cure Solidarity 9-6347"
141,126-150,28,026-030,"And as we all undress at night, in the dim light of the candles, our brothers are silent, for they dare not speak the thoughts of their minds"
118,101-125,24,021-025,"For all must agree with all, and they cannot know if their thoughts are the thoughts of all, and so they fear to speak"
58,051-075,12,011-015,"And they are glad when the candles are blown for the night"
122,101-125,22,021-025,"But we, Equality 7-2521, look through the window upon the sky, and there is peace in the sky, and cleanliness, and dignity"
121,101-125,22,021-025,"And beyond the City there lies the plain, and beyond the plain, black upon the black sky, there lies the Uncharted Forest"
48,051-075,10,009-010,"We do not wish to look upon the Uncharted Forest"
29,026-050,8,006-008,"We do not wish to think of it"
60,051-075,13,011-015,"But ever do our eyes return to that black patch upon the sky"
158,151-175,30,026-030,"Men never enter the Uncharted Forest, for there is no power to explore it and no path to lead among its ancient trees which stand as guards of fearful secrets"
153,151-175,30,026-030,"It is whispered that once or twice in a hundred years, one among the men of the City escape alone and run to the Uncharted Forest, without call or reason"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"These men do not return"
83,076-010,16,016-020,"They perish from hunger and from the claws of the wild beasts which roam the Forest"
47,051-075,10,009-010,"But our Councils say that this is only a legend"
83,076-010,15,011-015,"We have heard that there are many Uncharted Forests over the land, among the Cities"
97,076-010,18,016-020,"And it is whispered that they have grown over the ruins of many cities of the Unmentionable Times"
100,076-010,18,016-020,"The trees have swallowed the ruins, and the bones under the ruins, and all the things which perished"
109,101-125,21,021-025,"And as we look upon the Uncharted Forest far in the night, we think of the secrets of the Unmentionable Times"
75,076-010,16,016-020,"And we wonder how it came to pass that these secrets were lost to the world"
113,101-125,24,021-025,"We have heard the legends of the great fighting, in which many men fought on one side and only a few on the other"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"These few were the Evil Ones and they were conquered"
36,026-050,7,006-008,"Then great fires raged over the land"
85,076-010,18,016-020,"And in these fires the Evil Ones and all the things made by the Evil Ones were burned"
176,176-200,36,036-040,"And the fire which is called the Dawn of the Great Rebirth, was the Script Fire where all the scripts of the Evil Ones were burned, and with them all the words of the Evil Ones"
76,076-010,14,011-015,"Great mountains of flame stood in the squares of the Cities for three months"
27,026-050,5,003-005,"Then came the Great Rebirth"
26,026-050,6,006-008,"The words of the Evil Ones"
36,026-050,6,006-008,"The words of the Unmentionable Times"
37,026-050,8,006-008,"What are the words which we have lost"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"May the Council have mercy upon us"
98,076-010,22,021-025,"We had no wish to write such a question, and we knew not what we were doing till we had written it"
56,051-075,12,011-015,"We shall not ask this question and we shall not think it"
37,026-050,8,006-008,"We shall not call death upon our head"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"And yet"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"And yet"
91,076-010,19,016-020,"There is some word, one single word which is not in the language of men, but which had been"
65,076-010,13,011-015,"And this is the Unspeakable Word, which no men may speak nor hear"
81,076-010,14,011-015,"But sometimes, and it is rare, sometimes, somewhere, one among men find that word"
87,076-010,16,016-020,"They find it upon scraps of old manuscripts or cut into the fragments of ancient stones"
44,051-075,10,009-010,"But when they speak it they are put to death"
103,101-125,19,016-020,"There is no crime punished by death in this world, save this one crime of speaking the Unspeakable Word"
67,076-010,15,011-015,"We have seen one of such men burned alive in the square of the City"
120,101-125,26,026-030,"And it was a sight which has stayed with us through the years, and it haunts us, and follows us, and it gives us no rest"
35,026-050,8,006-008,"We were a child then, ten years old"
110,101-125,23,021-025,"And we stood in the great square with all the children and all the men of the City, sent to behold the burning"
79,076-010,15,011-015,"They brought the Transgressor out into the square and they led them to the pyre"
84,076-010,16,016-020,"They had torn out the tongue of the Transgressor, so that they could speak no longer"
36,026-050,6,006-008,"The Transgressor were young and tall"
46,051-075,10,009-010,"They had hair of gold and eyes blue as morning"
54,051-075,11,011-015,"They walked to the pyre, and their step did not falter"
153,151-175,29,026-030,"And of all the faces on that square, of all the faces which shrieked and screamed and spat curses upon them, theirs was the calmest and the happiest face"
121,101-125,24,021-025,"As the chains were wound over their body at the stake, and a flame set to the pyre, the Transgressor looked upon the City"
100,076-010,19,016-020,"There was a thin thread of blood running from the corner of their mouth, but their lips were smiling"
64,076-010,13,011-015,"And a monstrous thought came to us then, which has never left us"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"We had heard of Saints"
98,076-010,19,016-020,"There are the Saints of Labor, and the Saints of the Councils, and the Saints of the Great Rebirth"
72,076-010,16,016-020,"But we had never seen a Saint nor what the likeness of a Saint should be"
171,151-175,33,031-035,"And we thought then, standing in the square, that the likeness of a Saint was the face we saw before us in the flames, the face of the Transgressor of the Unspeakable Word"
98,076-010,20,016-020,"As the flames rose, a thing happened which no eyes saw but ours, else we would not be living today"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"Perhaps it had only seemed to us"
116,101-125,23,021-025,"But it seemed to us that the eyes of the Transgressor had chosen us from the crowd and were looking straight upon us"
75,076-010,16,016-020,"There was no pain in their eyes and no knowledge of the agony of their body"
87,076-010,19,016-020,"There was only joy in them, and pride, a pride holier than is fit for human pride to be"
129,126-150,25,021-025,"And it seemed as if these eyes were trying to tell us something through the flames, to send into our eyes some word without sound"
114,101-125,26,026-030,"And it seemed as if these eyes were begging us to gather that word and not to let it go from us and from the earth"
51,051-075,11,011-015,"But the flames rose and we could not guess the word"
91,076-010,18,016-020,"What—even if we have to burn for it like the Saint of the Pyre—what is the Unspeakable Word"
58,051-075,10,009-010,"We, Equality 7-2521, have discovered a new power of nature"
60,051-075,13,011-015,"And we have discovered it alone, and we alone are to know it"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"It is said"
39,026-050,10,009-010,"Now let us be lashed for it, if we must"
137,126-150,27,026-030,"The Council of Scholars has said that we all know the things which exist and therefore the things which are not known by all do not exist"
50,051-075,10,009-010,"But we think that the Council of Scholars is blind"
91,076-010,20,016-020,"The secrets of this earth are not for all men to see, but only for those who will seek them"
63,076-010,13,011-015,"We know, for we have found a secret unknown to all our brothers"
50,051-075,11,011-015,"We know not what this power is nor whence it comes"
61,051-075,13,011-015,"But we know its nature, we have watched it and worked with it"
29,026-050,7,006-008,"We saw it first two years ago"
83,076-010,18,016-020,"One night, we were cutting open the body of a dead frog when we saw its leg jerking"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"It was dead, yet it moved"
44,051-075,9,009-010,"Some power unknown to men was making it move"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"We could not understand it"
43,051-075,8,006-008,"Then, after many tests, we found the answer"
169,151-175,35,031-035,"The frog had been hanging on a wire of copper; and it had been the metal of our knife which had sent the strange power to the copper through the brine of the frog’s body"
199,176-200,42,041-045,"We put a piece of copper and a piece of zinc into a jar of brine, we touched a wire to them, and there, under our fingers, was a miracle which had never occurred before, a new miracle and a new power"
25,026-050,4,003-005,"This discovery haunted us"
47,051-075,9,009-010,"We followed it in preference to all our studies"
123,101-125,24,021-025,"We worked with it, we tested it in more ways than we can describe, and each step was as another miracle unveiling before us"
61,051-075,13,011-015,"We came to know that we had found the greatest power on earth"
39,026-050,9,009-010,"For it defies all the laws known to men"
260,251-275,52,051-055,"It makes the needle move and turn on the compass which we stole from the Home of the Scholars; but we had been taught, when still a child, that the loadstone points to the north and that this is a law which nothing can change; yet our new power defies all laws"
81,076-010,14,011-015,"We found that it causes lightning, and never have men known what causes lightning"
100,076-010,21,021-025,"In thunderstorms, we raised a tall rod of iron by the side of our hole, and we watched it from below"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"We have seen the lightning strike it again and again"
98,076-010,22,021-025,"And now we know that metal draws the power of the sky, and that metal can be made to give it forth"
56,051-075,10,009-010,"We have built strange things with this discovery of ours"
68,076-010,14,011-015,"We used for it the copper wires which we found here under the ground"
71,076-010,14,011-015,"We have walked the length of our tunnel, with a candle lighting the way"
83,076-010,18,016-020,"We could go no farther than half a mile, for earth and rock had fallen at both ends"
77,076-010,16,016-020,"But we gathered all the things we found and we brought them to our work place"
96,076-010,18,016-020,"We found strange boxes with bars of metal inside, with many cords and strands and coils of metal"
131,126-150,24,021-025,"We found wires that led to strange little globes of glass on the walls; they contained threads of metal thinner than a spider’s web"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"These things help us in our work"
152,151-175,30,026-030,"We do not understand them, but we think that the men of the Unmentionable Times had known our power of the sky, and these things had some relation to it"
34,026-050,8,006-008,"We do not know, but we shall learn"
82,076-010,16,016-020,"We cannot stop now, even though it frightens us that we are alone in our knowledge"
107,101-125,20,016-020,"No single one can possess greater wisdom than the many Scholars who are elected by all men for their wisdom"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"Yet we can"
5,000-010,2,000-002,"We do"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"We have fought against saying it, but now it is said"
14,011-025,4,003-005,"We do not care"
72,076-010,15,011-015,"We forget all men, all laws and all things save our metals and our wires"
30,026-050,7,006-008,"So much is still to be learned"
74,076-010,17,016-020,"So long a road lies before us, and what care we if we must travel it alone"
62,076-010,12,011-015,"Many days passed before we could speak to the Golden One again"
193,176-200,41,041-045,"But then came the day when the sky turned white, as if the sun had burst and spread its flame in the air, and the fields lay still without breath, and the dust of the road was white in the glow"
116,101-125,24,021-025,"So the women of the field were weary, and they tarried over their work, and they were far from the road when we came"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"But the Golden One stood alone at the hedge, waiting"
138,126-150,29,026-030,"We stopped and we saw that their eyes, so hard and scornful to the world, were looking at us as if they would obey any word we might speak"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"And we said:"
57,051-075,11,011-015,"“We have given you a name in our thoughts, Liberty 5-3000"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"“What is our name"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"” they asked"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"“The Golden One"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
56,051-075,12,011-015,"“Nor do we call you Equality 7-2521 when we think of you"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"“What name have you given us"
85,076-010,16,016-020,"” They looked straight into our eyes and they held their head high and they answered:"
16,011-025,2,000-002,"“The Unconquered"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
34,026-050,8,006-008,"For a long time we could not speak"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"Then we said:"
49,051-075,8,006-008,"“Such thoughts as these are forbidden, Golden One"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
67,076-010,14,011-015,"“But you think such thoughts as these and you wish us to think them"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
46,051-075,10,009-010,"We looked into their eyes and we could not lie"
88,076-010,17,016-020,"“Yes,” we whispered, and they smiled, and then we said: “Our dearest one, do not obey us"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
53,051-075,10,009-010,"They stepped back, and their eyes were wide and still"
41,051-075,6,006-008,"“Speak these words again,” they whispered"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"“Which words"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"” we asked"
39,026-050,9,009-010,"But they did not answer, and we knew it"
31,026-050,5,003-005,"“Our dearest one,” we whispered"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"Never have men said this to women"
196,176-200,38,036-040,"The head of the Golden One bowed slowly, and they stood still before us, their arms at their sides, the palms of their hands turned to us, as if their body were delivered in submission to our eyes"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"And we could not speak"
119,101-125,23,021-025,"Then they raised their head, and they spoke simply and gently, as if they wished us to forget some anxiety of their own"
86,076-010,18,016-020,"“The day is hot,” they said, “and you have worked for many hours and you must be weary"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"“No,” we answered"
69,076-010,14,011-015,"“It is cooler in the fields,” they said, “and there is water to drink"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"Are you thirsty"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
50,051-075,9,009-010,"“Yes,” we answered, “but we cannot cross the hedge"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
44,051-075,9,009-010,"“We shall bring the water to you,” they said"
118,101-125,24,021-025,"Then they knelt by the moat, they gathered water in their two hands, they rose and they held the water out to our lips"
37,026-050,9,009-010,"We do not know if we drank that water"
141,126-150,28,026-030,"We only knew suddenly that their hands were empty, but we were still holding our lips to their hands, and that they knew it, but did not move"
35,026-050,7,006-008,"We raised our head and stepped back"
87,076-010,18,016-020,"For we did not understand what had made us do this, and we were afraid to understand it"
77,076-010,14,011-015,"And the Golden One stepped back, and stood looking upon their hands in wonder"
200,176-200,38,036-040,"Then the Golden One moved away, even though no others were coming, and they moved, stepping back, as if they could not turn from us, their arms bent before them, as if they could not lower their hands"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"We made it"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"We created it"
46,051-075,10,009-010,"We brought it forth from the night of the ages"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"We alone"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"Our hands"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"Our mind"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"Ours alone and only"
30,026-050,7,006-008,"We know not what we are saying"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"Our head is reeling"
41,051-075,9,009-010,"We look upon the light which we have made"
48,051-075,9,009-010,"We shall be forgiven for anything we say tonight"
249,226-250,45,041-045,"Tonight, after more days and trials than we can count, we finished building a strange thing, from the remains of the Unmentionable Times, a box of glass, devised to give forth the power of the sky of greater strength than we had ever achieved before"
81,076-010,16,016-020,"And when we put our wires to this box, when we closed the current—the wire glowed"
80,076-010,18,016-020,"It came to life, it turned red, and a circle of light lay on the stone before us"
43,051-075,10,009-010,"We stood, and we held our head in our hands"
50,051-075,10,009-010,"We could not conceive of that which we had created"
37,026-050,8,006-008,"We had touched no flint, made no fire"
79,076-010,15,011-015,"Yet here was light, light that came from nowhere, light from the heart of metal"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"We blew out the candle"
21,011-025,3,003-005,"Darkness swallowed us"
121,101-125,26,026-030,"There was nothing left around us, nothing save night and a thin thread of flame in it, as a crack in the wall of a prison"
74,076-010,16,016-020,"We stretched our hands to the wire, and we saw our fingers in the red glow"
129,126-150,27,026-030,"We could not see our body nor feel it, and in that moment nothing existed save our two hands over a wire glowing in a black abyss"
58,051-075,12,011-015,"Then we thought of the meaning of that which lay before us"
104,101-125,21,021-025,"We can light our tunnel, and the City, and all the Cities of the world with nothing save metal and wires"
88,076-010,17,016-020,"We can give our brothers a new light, cleaner and brighter than any they have ever known"
52,051-075,12,011-015,"The power of the sky can be made to do men’s bidding"
113,101-125,25,021-025,"There are no limits to its secrets and its might, and it can be made to grant us anything if we but choose to ask"
28,026-050,7,006-008,"Then we knew what we must do"
75,076-010,15,011-015,"Our discovery is too great for us to waste our time in sweeping the streets"
69,076-010,13,011-015,"We must not keep our secret to ourselves, nor buried under the ground"
42,051-075,10,009-010,"We must bring it into the sight of all men"
146,126-150,30,026-030,"We need all our time, we need the work rooms of the Home of the Scholars, we want the help of our brother Scholars and their wisdom joined to ours"
76,076-010,17,016-020,"There is so much work ahead for all of us, for all the Scholars of the world"
64,076-010,14,011-015,"In a month, the World Council of Scholars is to meet in our City"
130,126-150,27,026-030,"It is a great Council, to which the wisest of all lands are elected, and it meets once a year in the different Cities of the earth"
111,101-125,24,021-025,"We shall go to this Council and we shall lay before them, as our gift, this glass box with the power of the sky"
35,026-050,6,006-008,"We shall confess everything to them"
37,026-050,6,006-008,"They will see, understand and forgive"
46,051-075,8,006-008,"For our gift is greater than our transgression"
102,101-125,20,016-020,"They will explain it to the Council of Vocations, and we shall be assigned to the Home of the Scholars"
93,076-010,19,016-020,"This has never been done before, but neither has a gift such as ours ever been offered to men"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"We must wait"
58,051-075,12,011-015,"We must guard our tunnel as we had never guarded it before"
113,101-125,21,021-025,"For should any men save the Scholars learn of our secret, they would not understand it, nor would they believe us"
96,076-010,18,016-020,"They would see nothing, save our crime of working alone, and they would destroy us and our light"
44,051-075,10,009-010,"We care not about our body, but our light is"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"Yes, we do care"
44,051-075,10,009-010,"For the first time do we care about our body"
86,076-010,20,016-020,"For this wire is as a part of our body, as a vein torn from us, glowing with our blood"
107,101-125,24,021-025,"Are we proud of this thread of metal, or of our hands which made it, or is there a line to divide these two"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"We stretch out our arms"
53,051-075,12,011-015,"For the first time do we know how strong our arms are"
95,076-010,20,016-020,"And a strange thought comes to us: we wonder, for the first time in our life, what we look like"
129,126-150,26,026-030,"Men never see their own faces and never ask their brothers about it, for it is evil to have concern for their own faces or bodies"
113,101-125,23,021-025,"But tonight, for a reason we cannot fathom, we wish it were possible to us to know the likeness of our own person"
35,026-050,7,006-008,"We have not written for thirty days"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"For thirty days we have not been here, in our tunnel"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"We had been caught"
44,051-075,9,009-010,"It happened on that night when we wrote last"
142,126-150,29,026-030,"We forgot, that night, to watch the sand in the glass which tells us when three hours have passed and it is time to return to the City Theatre"
43,051-075,9,009-010,"When we remembered it, the sand had run out"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"We hastened to the Theatre"
54,051-075,11,011-015,"But the big tent stood grey and silent against the sky"
53,051-075,11,011-015,"The streets of the City lay before us, dark and empty"
84,076-010,19,016-020,"If we went back to hide in our tunnel, we would be found and our light found with us"
47,051-075,10,009-010,"So we walked to the Home of the Street Sweepers"
154,151-175,30,026-030,"When the Council of the Home questioned us, we looked upon the faces of the Council, but there was no curiosity in those faces, and no anger, and no mercy"
57,051-075,12,011-015,"So when the oldest of them asked us: “Where have you been"
70,076-010,16,016-020,"” we thought of our glass box and of our light, and we forgot all else"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"And we answered:"
21,011-025,5,003-005,"“We will not tell you"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
38,026-050,7,006-008,"The oldest did not question us further"
69,076-010,13,011-015,"They turned to the two youngest, and said, and their voice was bored:"
71,076-010,11,011-015,"“Take our brother Equality 7-2521 to the Palace of Corrective Detention"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"Lash them until they tell"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
75,076-010,14,011-015,"So we were taken to the Stone Room under the Palace of Corrective Detention"
62,076-010,14,011-015,"This room has no windows and it is empty save for an iron post"
90,076-010,17,016-020,"Two men stood by the post, naked but for leather aprons and leather hoods over their faces"
97,076-010,20,016-020,"Those who had brought us departed, leaving us to the two Judges who stood in a corner of the room"
46,051-075,9,009-010,"The Judges were small, thin men, grey and bent"
50,051-075,10,009-010,"They gave the signal to the two strong hooded ones"
111,101-125,23,021-025,"They tore the clothes from our body, they threw us down upon our knees and they tied our hands to the iron post"
67,076-010,16,016-020,"The first blow of the lash felt as if our spine had been cut in two"
144,126-150,29,026-030,"The second blow stopped the first, and for a second we felt nothing, then the pain struck us in our throat and fire ran in our lungs without air"
22,026-050,6,006-008,"But we did not cry out"
37,026-050,7,006-008,"The lash whistled like a singing wind"
46,051-075,10,009-010,"We tried to count the blows, but we lost count"
49,051-075,10,009-010,"We knew that the blows were falling upon our back"
45,051-075,9,009-010,"Only we felt nothing upon our back any longer"
363,more,70,more,"A flaming grill kept dancing before our eyes, and we thought of nothing save that grill, a grill, a grill of red squares, and then we knew that we were looking at the squares of the iron grill in the door, and there were also the squares of stone on the walls, and the squares which the lash was cutting upon our back, crossing and re-crossing itself in our flesh"
28,026-050,7,006-008,"Then we saw a fist before us"
107,101-125,22,021-025,"It knocked our chin up, and we saw the red froth of our mouth on the withered fingers, and the Judge asked:"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"“Where have you been"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
79,076-010,17,016-020,"But we jerked our head away, hid our face upon our tied hands, and bit our lips"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"The lash whistled again"
122,101-125,23,021-025,"We wondered who was sprinkling burning coal dust upon the floor, for we saw drops of red twinkling on the stones around us"
136,126-150,23,021-025,"Then we knew nothing, save two voices snarling steadily, one after the other, even though we knew they were speaking many minutes apart:"
80,076-010,16,016-020,"“Where have you been where have you been where have you been where have you been"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
88,076-010,17,016-020,"And our lips moved, but the sound trickled back into our throat, and the sound was only:"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"“The light"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"The light"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"The light"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"Then we knew nothing"
69,076-010,15,011-015,"We opened our eyes, lying on our stomach on the brick floor of a cell"
115,101-125,24,021-025,"We looked upon two hands lying far before us on the bricks, and we moved them, and we knew that they were our hands"
30,026-050,7,006-008,"But we could not move our body"
75,076-010,16,016-020,"Then we smiled, for we thought of the light and that we had not betrayed it"
32,026-050,8,006-008,"We lay in our cell for many days"
104,101-125,21,021-025,"The door opened twice each day, once for the men who brought us bread and water, and once for the Judges"
93,076-010,18,016-020,"Many Judges came to our cell, first the humblest and then the most honored Judges of the City"
58,051-075,11,011-015,"They stood before us in their white togas, and they asked:"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"“Are you ready to speak"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
53,051-075,11,011-015,"But we shook our head, lying before them on the floor"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"And they departed"
47,051-075,10,009-010,"We counted each day and each night as it passed"
42,051-075,8,006-008,"Then, tonight, we knew that we must escape"
65,076-010,13,011-015,"For tomorrow the World Council of Scholars is to meet in our City"
61,051-075,11,011-015,"It was easy to escape from the Palace of Corrective Detention"
60,051-075,13,011-015,"The locks are old on the doors and there are no guards about"
137,126-150,27,026-030,"There is no reason to have guards, for men have never defied the Councils so far as to escape from whatever place they were ordered to be"
55,051-075,10,009-010,"Our body is healthy and strength returns to it speedily"
42,051-075,9,009-010,"We lunged against the door and it gave way"
90,076-010,16,016-020,"We stole through the dark passages, and through the dark streets, and down into our tunnel"
91,076-010,19,016-020,"We lit the candle and we saw that our place had not been found and nothing had been touched"
69,076-010,16,016-020,"And our glass box stood before us on the cold oven, as we had left it"
45,051-075,9,009-010,"What matter they now, the scars upon our back"
142,126-150,28,026-030,"Tomorrow, in the full light of day, we shall take our box, and leave our tunnel open, and walk through the streets to the Home of the Scholars"
62,076-010,12,011-015,"We shall put before them the greatest gift ever offered to men"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"We shall tell them the truth"
69,076-010,13,011-015,"We shall hand to them, as our confession, these pages we have written"
114,101-125,23,021-025,"We shall join our hands to theirs, and we shall work together, with the power of the sky, for the glory of mankind"
35,026-050,6,006-008,"Our blessing upon you, our brothers"
83,076-010,17,016-020,"Tomorrow, you will take us back into your fold and we shall be an outcast no longer"
37,026-050,8,006-008,"Tomorrow we shall be one of you again"
8,000-010,1,000-002,"Tomorrow"
29,026-050,7,006-008,"It is dark here in the forest"
71,076-010,14,011-015,"The leaves rustle over our head, black against the last gold of the sky"
25,026-050,6,006-008,"The moss is soft and warm"
96,076-010,20,016-020,"We shall sleep on this moss for many nights, till the beasts of the forest come to tear our body"
65,076-010,14,011-015,"We have no bed now, save the moss, and no future, save the beasts"
137,126-150,28,026-030,"We are old now, yet we were young this morning, when we carried our glass box through the streets of the City to the Home of the Scholars"
113,101-125,20,016-020,"No men stopped us, for there were none about from the Palace of Corrective Detention, and the others knew nothing"
29,026-050,7,006-008,"No men stopped us at the gate"
114,101-125,20,016-020,"We walked through empty passages and into the great hall where the World Council of Scholars sat in solemn meeting"
81,076-010,16,016-020,"We saw nothing as we entered, save the sky in the great windows, blue and glowing"
120,101-125,24,021-025,"Then we saw the Scholars who sat around a long table; they were as shapeless clouds huddled at the rise of the great sky"
101,101-125,19,016-020,"There were men whose famous names we knew, and others from distant lands whose names we had not heard"
111,101-125,21,021-025,"We saw a great painting on the wall over their heads, of the twenty illustrious men who had invented the candle"
55,051-075,12,011-015,"All the heads of the Council turned to us as we entered"
142,126-150,30,026-030,"These great and wise of the earth did not know what to think of us, and they looked upon us with wonder and curiosity, as if we were a miracle"
85,076-010,17,016-020,"It is true that our tunic was torn and stained with brown stains which had been blood"
36,026-050,8,006-008,"We raised our right arm and we said:"
75,076-010,13,011-015,"“Our greeting to you, our honored brothers of the World Council of Scholars"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
78,076-010,13,011-015,"Then Collective 0-0009, the oldest and wisest of the Council, spoke and asked:"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"“Who are you, our brother"
34,026-050,8,006-008,"For you do not look like a Scholar"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
85,076-010,16,016-020,"“Our name is Equality 7-2521,” we answered, “and we are a Street Sweeper of this City"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
124,101-125,25,021-025,"Then it was as if a great wind had stricken the hall, for all the Scholars spoke at once, and they were angry and frightened"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"“A Street Sweeper"
62,076-010,11,011-015,"A Street Sweeper walking in upon the World Council of Scholars"
24,026-050,6,006-008,"It is not to be believed"
44,051-075,10,009-010,"It is against all the rules and all the laws"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
28,026-050,7,006-008,"But we knew how to stop them"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"“Our brothers"
9,011-025,3,003-005,"” we said"
37,026-050,6,006-008,"“We matter not, nor our transgression"
37,026-050,8,006-008,"It is only our brother men who matter"
129,126-150,28,026-030,"Give no thought to us, for we are nothing, but listen to our words, for we bring you a gift such as had never been brought to men"
60,051-075,13,011-015,"Listen to us, for we hold the future of mankind in our hands"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"Then they listened"
50,051-075,10,009-010,"We placed our glass box upon the table before them"
115,101-125,23,021-025,"We spoke of it, and of our long quest, and of our tunnel, and of our escape from the Palace of Corrective Detention"
54,051-075,13,011-015,"Not a hand moved in that hall, as we spoke, nor an eye"
83,076-010,17,016-020,"Then we put the wires to the box, and they all bent forward and sat still, watching"
42,051-075,9,009-010,"And we stood still, our eyes upon the wire"
72,076-010,15,011-015,"And slowly, slowly as a flush of blood, a red flame trembled in the wire"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"Then the wire glowed"
40,026-050,8,006-008,"But terror struck the men of the Council"
173,151-175,30,026-030,"They leapt to their feet, they ran from the table, and they stood pressed against the wall, huddled together, seeking the warmth of one another’s bodies to give them courage"
44,051-075,9,009-010,"We looked upon them and we laughed and said:"
27,026-050,4,003-005,"“Fear nothing, our brothers"
62,076-010,13,011-015,"There is a great power in these wires, but this power is tamed"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"It is yours"
17,011-025,5,003-005,"We give it to you"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"Still they would not move"
33,026-050,8,006-008,"“We give you the power of the sky"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"” we cried"
33,026-050,8,006-008,"“We give you the key to the earth"
57,051-075,13,011-015,"Take it, and let us be one of you, the humblest among you"
82,076-010,17,016-020,"Let us all work together, and harness this power, and make it ease the toil of men"
45,051-075,9,009-010,"Let us throw away our candles and our torches"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"Let us flood our cities with light"
31,026-050,8,006-008,"Let us bring a new light to men"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"But they looked upon us, and suddenly we were afraid"
46,051-075,9,009-010,"For their eyes were still, and small, and evil"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"“Our brothers"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"” we cried"

1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
36,026-050,5,003-005,"Then Collective 0-0009 moved forward"
47,051-075,9,009-010,"They moved to the table and the others followed"
59,051-075,11,011-015,"“Yes,” spoke Collective 0-0009, “we have much to say to you"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
78,076-010,16,016-020,"The sound of their voices brought silence to the hall and to beat of our heart"
122,101-125,24,021-025,"“Yes,” said Collective 0-0009, “we have much to say to a wretch who have broken all the laws and who boast of their infamy"
87,076-010,16,016-020,"“How dared you think that your mind held greater wisdom than the minds of your brothers"
157,151-175,31,031-035,"And if the Councils had decreed that you should be a Street Sweeper, how dared you think that you could be of greater use to men than in sweeping the streets"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
141,126-150,26,026-030,"“How dared you, gutter cleaner,” spoke Fraternity 9-3452, “to hold yourself as one alone and with the thoughts of the one and not of the many"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
57,051-075,10,009-010,"“You shall be burned at the stake,” said Democracy 4-6998"
95,076-010,16,016-020,"“No, they shall be lashed,” said Unanimity 7-3304, “till there is nothing left under the lashes"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
71,076-010,11,011-015,"“No,” said Collective 0-0009, “we cannot decide upon this, our brothers"
68,076-010,15,011-015,"No such crime has ever been committed, and it is not for us to judge"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"Nor for any small Council"
85,076-010,16,016-020,"We shall deliver this creature to the World Council itself and let their will be done"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
35,026-050,7,006-008,"We looked upon them and we pleaded:"
13,011-025,2,000-002,"“Our brothers"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"You are right"
49,051-075,11,011-015,"Let the will of the Council be done upon our body"
14,011-025,4,003-005,"We do not care"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"But the light"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"What will you do with the light"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
49,051-075,8,006-008,"Collective 0-0009 looked upon us, and they smiled"
70,076-010,13,011-015,"“So you think that you have found a new power,” said Collective 0-0009"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"“Do all your brothers think that"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"“No,” we answered"
71,076-010,13,011-015,"“What is not thought by all men cannot be true,” said Collective 0-0009"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"“You have worked on this alone"
28,026-050,4,003-005,"” asked International 1-5537"
216,201-225,38,036-040,"“Many men in the Homes of the Scholars have had strange new ideas in the past,” said Solidarity 8-1164, “but when the majority of their brother Scholars voted against them, they abandoned their ideas, as all men must"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
43,051-075,7,006-008,"“This box is useless,” said Alliance 6-7349"
113,101-125,21,021-025,"“Should it be what they claim of it,” said Harmony 9-2642, “then it would bring ruin to the Department of Candles"
61,051-075,13,011-015,"The Candle is a great boon to mankind, as approved by all men"
51,051-075,10,009-010,"Therefore it cannot be destroyed by the whim of one"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
137,126-150,24,021-025,"“This would wreck the Plans of the World Council,” said Unanimity 2-9913, “and without the Plans of the World Council the sun cannot rise"
181,176-200,35,031-035,"It took fifty years to secure the approval of all the Councils for the Candle, and to decide upon the number needed, and to re-fit the Plans so as to make candles instead of torches"
76,076-010,13,011-015,"This touched upon thousands and thousands of men working in scores of States"
39,026-050,8,006-008,"We cannot alter the Plans again so soon"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
156,151-175,31,031-035,"“And if this should lighten the toil of men,” said Similarity 5-0306, “then it is a great evil, for men have no cause to exist save in toiling for other men"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
50,051-075,9,009-010,"Then Collective 0-0009 rose and pointed at our box"
43,051-075,7,006-008,"“This thing,” they said, “must be destroyed"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"And all the others cried as one:"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"“It must be destroyed"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
26,026-050,6,006-008,"Then we leapt to the table"
65,076-010,14,011-015,"We seized our box, we shoved them aside, and we ran to the window"
135,126-150,30,026-030,"We turned and we looked at them for the last time, and a rage, such as it is not fit for humans to know, choked our voice in our throat"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"“You fools"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"” we cried"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"“You fools"
23,026-050,3,003-005,"You thrice-damned fools"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
85,076-010,17,016-020,"We swung our fist through the windowpane, and we leapt out in a ringing rain of glass"
53,051-075,12,011-015,"We fell, but we never let the box fall from our hands"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"Then we ran"
78,076-010,15,011-015,"We ran blindly, and men and houses streaked past us in a torrent without shape"
148,126-150,34,031-035,"And the road seemed not to be flat before us, but as if it were leaping up to meet us, and we waited for the earth to rise and strike us in the face"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"But we ran"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"We knew not where we were going"
82,076-010,20,016-020,"We knew only that we must run, run to the end of the world, to the end of our days"
80,076-010,17,016-020,"Then we knew suddenly that we were lying on a soft earth and that we had stopped"
72,076-010,14,011-015,"Trees taller than we had ever seen before stood over us in great silence"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"Then we knew"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"We were in the Uncharted Forest"
140,126-150,27,026-030,"We had not thought of coming here, but our legs had carried our wisdom, and our legs had brought us to the Uncharted Forest against our will"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"Our glass box lay beside us"
73,076-010,17,016-020,"We crawled to it, we fell upon it, our face in our arms, and we lay still"
27,026-050,7,006-008,"We lay thus for a long time"
59,051-075,13,011-015,"Then we rose, we took our box and walked on into the forest"
29,026-050,6,006-008,"It mattered not where we went"
79,076-010,15,011-015,"We knew that men would not follow us, for they never enter the Uncharted Forest"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"We had nothing to fear from them"
38,026-050,7,006-008,"The forest disposes of its own victims"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"This gave us no fear either"
100,076-010,22,021-025,"Only we wished to be away, away from the City and from the air that touches upon the air of the City"
53,051-075,12,011-015,"So we walked on, our box in our arms, our heart empty"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"We are doomed"
55,051-075,11,011-015,"Whatever days are left to us, we shall spend them alone"
59,051-075,12,011-015,"And we have heard of the corruption to be found in solitude"
115,101-125,23,021-025,"We have torn ourselves from the truth which is our brother men, and there is no road back for us, and no redemption"
40,026-050,9,009-010,"We know these things, but we do not care"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"We care for nothing on earth"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"We are tired"
76,076-010,16,016-020,"Only the glass box in our arms is like a living heart that gives us strength"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"We have lied to ourselves"
55,051-075,12,011-015,"We have not built this box for the good of our brothers"
28,026-050,7,006-008,"We built it for its own sake"
67,076-010,14,011-015,"It is above all our brothers to us, and its truth above their truth"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"Why wonder about this"
29,026-050,7,006-008,"We have not many days to live"
79,076-010,14,011-015,"We are walking to the fangs awaiting us somewhere among the great, silent trees"
40,026-050,9,009-010,"There is not a thing behind us to regret"
53,051-075,12,011-015,"Then a blow of pain struck us, our first and our only"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"We thought of the Golden One"
58,051-075,12,011-015,"We thought of the Golden One whom we shall never see again"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"Then the pain passed"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"It is best"
24,026-050,6,006-008,"We are one of the Damned"
78,076-010,17,016-020,"It is best if the Golden One forget our name and the body which bore that name"
62,076-010,14,011-015,"It has been a day of wonder, this, our first day in the forest"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"We awoke when a ray of sunlight fell across our face"
173,151-175,36,036-040,"We wanted to leap to our feet, as we have had to leap every morning of our life, but we remembered suddenly that no bell had rung and that there was no bell to ring anywhere"
70,076-010,17,016-020,"We lay on our back, we threw our arms out, and we looked up at the sky"
109,101-125,21,021-025,"The leaves had edges of silver that trembled and rippled like a river of green and fire flowing high above us"
23,026-050,6,006-008,"We did not wish to move"
100,076-010,20,016-020,"We thought suddenly that we could lie thus as long as we wished, and we laughed aloud at the thought"
55,051-075,12,011-015,"We could also rise, or run, or leap, or fall down again"
109,101-125,21,021-025,"We were thinking that these were thoughts without sense, but before we knew it our body had risen in one leap"
140,126-150,27,026-030,"Our arms stretched out of their own will, and our body whirled and whirled, till it raised a wind to rustle through the leaves of the bushes"
126,126-150,26,026-030,"Then our hands seized a branch and swung us high into a tree, with no aim save the wonder of learning the strength of our body"
80,076-010,17,016-020,"The branch snapped under us and we fell upon the moss that was soft as a cushion"
116,101-125,24,021-025,"Then our body, losing all sense, rolled over and over on the moss, dry leaves in our tunic, in our hair, in our face"
120,101-125,22,021-025,"And we heard suddenly that we were laughing, laughing aloud, laughing as if there were no power left in us save laughter"
58,051-075,13,011-015,"Then we took our glass box, and we went on into the forest"
219,201-225,41,041-045,"We went on, cutting through the branches, and it was as if we were swimming through a sea of leaves, with the bushes as waves rising and falling and rising around us, and flinging their green sprays high to the treetops"
46,051-075,8,006-008,"The trees parted before us, calling us forward"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"The forest seemed to welcome us"
89,076-010,17,016-020,"We went on, without thought, without care, with nothing to feel save the song of our body"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"We stopped when we felt hunger"
70,076-010,13,011-015,"We saw birds in the tree branches, and flying from under our footsteps"
54,051-075,14,011-015,"We picked a stone and we sent it as an arrow at a bird"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"It fell before us"
91,076-010,21,021-025,"We made a fire, we cooked the bird, and we ate it, and no meal had ever tasted better to us"
124,101-125,25,021-025,"And we thought suddenly that there was a great satisfaction to be found in the food which we need and obtain by our own hand"
100,076-010,20,016-020,"And we wished to be hungry again and soon, that we might know again this strange new pride in eating"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"Then we walked on"
70,076-010,16,016-020,"And we came to a stream which lay as a streak of glass among the trees"
135,126-150,30,026-030,"It lay so still that we saw no water but only a cut in the earth, in which the trees grew down, upturned, and the sky lay at the bottom"
48,051-075,11,011-015,"We knelt by the stream and we bent down to drink"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"And then we stopped"
78,076-010,18,016-020,"For, upon the blue of the sky below us, we saw our own face for the first time"
35,026-050,8,006-008,"We sat still and we held our breath"
40,026-050,8,006-008,"For our face and our body were beautiful"
90,076-010,19,016-020,"Our face was not like the faces of our brothers, for we felt not pity when looking upon it"
106,101-125,21,021-025,"Our body was not like the bodies of our brothers, for our limbs were straight and thin and hard and strong"
129,126-150,26,026-030,"And we thought that we could trust this being who looked upon us from the stream, and that we had nothing to fear with this being"
33,026-050,8,006-008,"We walked on till the sun had set"
113,101-125,20,016-020,"When the shadows gathered among the trees, we stopped in a hollow between the roots, where we shall sleep tonight"
79,076-010,15,011-015,"And suddenly, for the first time this day, we remembered that we are the Damned"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"We remembered it, and we laughed"
165,151-175,32,031-035,"We are writing this on the paper we had hidden in our tunic together with the written pages we had brought for the World Council of Scholars, but never given to them"
101,101-125,23,021-025,"We have much to speak of to ourselves, and we hope we shall find the words for it in the days to come"
46,051-075,8,006-008,"Now, we cannot speak, for we cannot understand"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"We have not written for many days"
24,026-050,6,006-008,"We did not wish to speak"
64,076-010,13,011-015,"For we needed no words to remember that which has happened to us"
68,076-010,15,011-015,"It was on our second day in the forest that we heard steps behind us"
35,026-050,8,006-008,"We hid in the bushes, and we waited"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"The steps came closer"
78,076-010,18,016-020,"And then we saw the fold of a white tunic among the trees, and a gleam of gold"
74,076-010,15,011-015,"We leapt forward, we ran to them, and we stood looking upon the Golden One"
152,151-175,29,026-030,"They saw us, and their hands closed into fists, and the fists pulled their arms down, as if they wished their arms to hold them, while their body swayed"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"And they could not speak"
35,026-050,8,006-008,"We dared not come too close to them"
33,026-050,6,006-008,"We asked, and our voice trembled:"
40,026-050,9,009-010,"“How did you come to be here, Golden One"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
24,026-050,4,003-005,"But they whispered only:"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"“We have found you"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
37,026-050,9,009-010,"“How did you come to be in the forest"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"” we asked"
82,076-010,15,011-015,"They raised their head, and there was a great pride in their voice; they answered:"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"“We have followed you"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
39,026-050,8,006-008,"Then we could not speak, and they said:"
89,076-010,18,016-020,"“We heard that you had gone to the Uncharted Forest, for the whole City is speaking of it"
86,076-010,20,016-020,"So on the night of the day when we heard it, we ran away from the Home of the Peasants"
66,076-010,14,011-015,"We found the marks of your feet across the plain where no men walk"
118,101-125,23,021-025,"So we followed them, and we went into the forest, and we followed the path where the branches were broken by your body"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
162,151-175,33,031-035,"Their white tunic was torn, and the branches had cut the skin of their arms, but they spoke as if they had never taken notice of it, nor of weariness, nor of fear"
75,076-010,14,011-015,"“We have followed you,” they said, “and we shall follow you wherever you go"
46,051-075,9,009-010,"If danger threatens you, we shall face it also"
37,026-050,9,009-010,"If it be death, we shall die with you"
51,051-075,10,009-010,"You are damned, and we wish to share your damnation"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
97,076-010,18,016-020,"They looked upon us, and their voice was low, but there was bitterness and triumph in their voice"
70,076-010,14,011-015,"“Your eyes are as a flame, but our brothers have neither hope nor fire"
66,076-010,13,011-015,"Your mouth is cut of granite, but our brothers are soft and humble"
42,051-075,8,006-008,"Your head is high, but our brothers cringe"
32,026-050,6,006-008,"You walk, but our brothers crawl"
72,076-010,14,011-015,"We wish to be damned with you, rather than blessed with all our brothers"
58,051-075,14,011-015,"Do as you please with us, but do not send us away from you"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
54,051-075,10,009-010,"Then they knelt, and bowed their golden head before us"
41,051-075,9,009-010,"We had never thought of that which we did"
109,101-125,23,021-025,"We bent to raise the Golden One to their feet, but when we touched them, it was as if madness had stricken us"
54,051-075,11,011-015,"We seized their body and we pressed our lips to theirs"
95,076-010,18,016-020,"The Golden One breathed once, and their breath was a moan, and then their arms closed around us"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"We stood together for a long time"
109,101-125,21,021-025,"And we were frightened that we had lived for twenty-one years and had never known what joy is possible to men"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"Then we said:"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"“Our dearest one"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"Fear nothing of the forest"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"There is no danger in solitude"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"We have no need of our brothers"
132,126-150,28,026-030,"Let us forget their good and our evil, let us forget all things save that we are together and that there is joy as a bond between us"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"Give us your hand"
10,011-025,2,000-002,"Look ahead"
70,076-010,14,011-015,"It is our own world, Golden One, a strange, unknown world, but our own"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
53,051-075,11,011-015,"Then we walked on into the forest, their hand in ours"
142,126-150,30,026-030,"And that night we knew that to hold the body of women in our arms is neither ugly nor shameful, but the one ecstasy granted to the race of men"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"We have walked for many days"
41,051-075,10,009-010,"The forest has no end, and we seek no end"
89,076-010,19,016-020,"But each day added to the chain of days between us and the City is like an added blessing"
34,026-050,8,006-008,"We have made a bow and many arrows"
87,076-010,19,016-020,"We can kill more birds than we need for our food; we find water and fruit in the forest"
70,076-010,15,011-015,"At night, we choose a clearing, and we build a ring of fires around it"
69,076-010,15,011-015,"We sleep in the midst of that ring, and the beasts dare not attack us"
91,076-010,17,016-020,"We can see their eyes, green and yellow as coals, watching us from the tree branches beyond"
123,101-125,24,021-025,"The fires smoulder as a crown of jewels around us, and smoke stands still in the air, in columns made blue by the moonlight"
108,101-125,22,021-025,"We sleep together in the midst of the ring, the arms of the Golden One around us, their head upon our breast"
77,076-010,16,016-020,"Some day, we shall stop and build a house, when we shall have gone far enough"
28,026-050,7,006-008,"But we do not have to hasten"
51,051-075,10,009-010,"The days before us are without end, like the forest"
91,076-010,18,016-020,"We cannot understand this new life which we have found, yet it seems so clear and so simple"
118,101-125,22,021-025,"When questions come to puzzle us, we walk faster, then turn and forget all things as we watch the Golden One following"
113,101-125,21,021-025,"The shadows of leaves fall upon their arms, as they spread the branches apart, but their shoulders are in the sun"
154,151-175,31,031-035,"The skin of their arms is like a blue mist, but their shoulders are white and glowing, as if the light fell not from above, but rose from under their skin"
143,126-150,30,026-030,"We watch the leaf which has fallen upon their shoulder, and it lies at the curve of their neck, and a drop of dew glistens upon it like a jewel"
147,126-150,26,026-030,"They approach us, and they stop, laughing, knowing what we think, and they wait obediently, without questions, till it pleases us to turn and go on"
46,051-075,11,011-015,"We go on and we bless the earth under our feet"
53,051-075,11,011-015,"But questions come to us again, as we walk in silence"
101,101-125,19,016-020,"If that which we have found is the corruption of solitude, then what can men wish for save corruption"
76,076-010,17,016-020,"If this is the great evil of being alone, then what is good and what is evil"
44,051-075,8,006-008,"Everything which comes from the many is good"
39,026-050,7,006-008,"Everything which comes from one is evil"
46,051-075,9,009-010,"This have we been taught with our first breath"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"We have broken the law, but we have never doubted it"
64,076-010,13,011-015,"Yet now, as we walk through the forest, we are learning to doubt"
80,076-010,17,016-020,"There is no life for men, save in useful toil for the good of all their brothers"
69,076-010,14,011-015,"But we lived not, when we toiled for our brothers, we were only weary"
68,076-010,14,011-015,"There is no joy for men, save the joy shared with all their brothers"
98,076-010,20,016-020,"But the only things which taught us joy were the power we created in our wires, and the Golden One"
155,151-175,31,031-035,"And both these joys belong to us alone, they come from us alone, they bear no relation to all our brothers, and they do not concern our brothers in any way"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"Thus do we wonder"
64,076-010,12,011-015,"There is some error, one frightful error, in the thinking of men"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"What is that error"
75,076-010,14,011-015,"We do not know, but the knowledge struggles within us, struggles to be born"
48,051-075,8,006-008,"Today, the Golden One stopped suddenly and said:"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"“We love you"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
65,076-010,12,011-015,"But they frowned and shook their head and looked at us helplessly"
56,051-075,11,011-015,"“No,” they whispered, “that is not what we wished to say"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
135,126-150,25,021-025,"They were silent, then they spoke slowly, and their words were halting, like the words of a child learning to speak for the first time:"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"“We are one"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"alone"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"and only"
27,026-050,7,006-008,"and we love you who are one"
5,000-010,1,000-002,"alone"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"and only"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
126,126-150,25,021-025,"We looked into each other’s eyes and we knew that the breath of a miracle had touched us, and fled, and left us groping vainly"
54,051-075,12,011-015,"And we felt torn, torn for some word we could not find"
88,076-010,18,016-020,"We are sitting at a table and we are writing this upon paper made thousands of years ago"
105,101-125,23,021-025,"The light is dim, and we cannot see the Golden One, only one lock of gold on the pillow of an ancient bed"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"This is our home"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"We came upon it today, at sunrise"
55,051-075,11,011-015,"For many days we had been crossing a chain of mountains"
199,176-200,42,041-045,"The forest rose among cliffs, and whenever we walked out upon a barren stretch of rock we saw great peaks before us in the west, and to the north of us, and to the south, as far as our eyes could see"
125,101-125,24,021-025,"The peaks were red and brown, with the green streaks of forests as veins upon them, with blue mists as veils over their heads"
70,076-010,14,011-015,"We had never heard of these mountains, nor seen them marked on any map"
86,076-010,16,016-020,"The Uncharted Forest has protected them from the Cities and from the men of the Cities"
53,051-075,10,009-010,"We climbed paths where the wild goat dared not follow"
181,176-200,32,031-035,"Stones rolled from under our feet, and we heard them striking the rocks below, farther and farther down, and the mountains rang with each stroke, and long after the strokes had died"
85,076-010,19,016-020,"But we went on, for we knew that no men would ever follow our track nor reach us here"
92,076-010,19,016-020,"Then today, at sunrise, we saw a white flame among the trees, high on a sheer peak before us"
41,051-075,9,009-010,"We thought that it was a fire and stopped"
56,051-075,10,009-010,"But the flame was unmoving, yet blinding as liquid metal"
41,051-075,8,006-008,"So we climbed toward it through the rocks"
183,176-200,37,036-040,"And there, before us, on a broad summit, with the mountains rising behind it, stood a house such as we had never seen, and the white fire came from the sun on the glass of its windows"
60,051-075,13,011-015,"The house had two stories and a strange roof flat as a floor"
159,151-175,29,026-030,"There was more window than wall upon its walls, and the windows went on straight around the corners, though how this kept the house standing we could not guess"
90,076-010,18,016-020,"The walls were hard and smooth, of that stone unlike stone which we had seen in our tunnel"
79,076-010,14,011-015,"We both knew it without words: this house was left from the Unmentionable Times"
103,101-125,20,016-020,"The trees had protected it from time and weather, and from men who have less pity than time and weather"
41,051-075,9,009-010,"We turned to the Golden One and we asked:"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"“Are you afraid"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"But they shook their head"
113,101-125,22,021-025,"So we walked to the door, and we threw it open, and we stepped together into the house of the Unmentionable Times"
105,101-125,21,021-025,"We shall need the days and the years ahead, to look, to learn, and to understand the things of this house"
66,076-010,14,011-015,"Today, we could only look and try to believe the sight of our eyes"
150,126-150,29,026-030,"We pulled the heavy curtains from the windows and we saw that the rooms were small, and we thought that not more than twelve men could have lived here"
82,076-010,16,016-020,"We thought it strange that men had been permitted to build a house for only twelve"
40,026-050,9,009-010,"Never had we seen rooms so full of light"
152,151-175,28,026-030,"The sunrays danced upon colors, colors, more colors than we thought possible, we who had seen no houses save the white ones, the brown ones and the grey"
172,151-175,38,036-040,"There were great pieces of glass on the walls, but it was not glass, for when we looked upon it we saw our own bodies and all the things behind us, as on the face of a lake"
85,076-010,18,016-020,"There were strange things which we had never seen and the use of which we do not know"
132,126-150,25,021-025,"And there were globes of glass everywhere, in each room, the globes with the metal cobwebs inside, such as we had seen in our tunnel"
65,076-010,13,011-015,"We found the sleeping hall and we stood in awe upon its threshold"
58,051-075,14,011-015,"For it was a small room and there were only two beds in it"
113,101-125,22,021-025,"We found no other beds in the house, and then we knew that only two had lived here, and this passes understanding"
68,076-010,13,011-015,"What kind of world did they have, the men of the Unmentionable Times"
65,076-010,13,011-015,"We found garments, and the Golden One gasped at the sight of them"
94,076-010,19,016-020,"For they were not white tunics, nor white togas; they were of all colors, no two of them alike"
40,026-050,8,006-008,"Some crumbled to dust as we touched them"
75,076-010,15,011-015,"But others were of heavier cloth, and they felt soft and new in our fingers"
105,101-125,20,016-020,"We found a room with walls made of shelves, which held rows of manuscripts, from the floor to the ceiling"
66,076-010,14,011-015,"Never had we seen such a number of them, nor of such strange shape"
183,176-200,36,036-040,"They were not soft and rolled, they had hard shells of cloth and leather; and the letters on their pages were so small and so even that we wondered at the men who had such handwriting"
134,126-150,25,021-025,"We glanced through the pages, and we saw that they were written in our language, but we found many words which we could not understand"
46,051-075,8,006-008,"Tomorrow, we shall begin to read these scripts"
114,101-125,25,021-025,"When we had seen all the rooms of the house, we looked at the Golden One and we both knew the thought in our minds"
72,076-010,15,011-015,"“We shall never leave this house,” we said, “nor let it be taken from us"
43,051-075,10,009-010,"This is our home and the end of our journey"
113,101-125,23,021-025,"This is your house, Golden One, and ours, and it belongs to no other men whatever as far as the earth may stretch"
98,076-010,21,021-025,"We shall not share it with others, as we share not our joy with them, nor our love, nor our hunger"
31,026-050,9,009-010,"So be it to the end of our days"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"“Your will be done,” they said"
64,076-010,14,011-015,"Then we went out to gather wood for the great hearth of our home"
77,076-010,14,011-015,"We brought water from the stream which runs among the trees under our windows"
171,151-175,35,031-035,"We killed a mountain goat, and we brought its flesh to be cooked in a strange copper pot we found in a place of wonders, which must have been the cooking room of the house"
113,101-125,24,021-025,"We did this work alone, for no words of ours could take the Golden One away from the big glass which is not glass"
67,076-010,13,011-015,"They stood before it and they looked and looked upon their own body"
139,126-150,25,021-025,"When the sun sank beyond the mountains, the Golden One fell asleep on the floor, amidst jewels, and bottles of crystal, and flowers of silk"
110,101-125,22,021-025,"We lifted the Golden One in our arms and we carried them to a bed, their head falling softly upon our shoulder"
146,126-150,30,026-030,"Then we lit a candle, and we brought paper from the room of the manuscripts, and we sat by the window, for we knew that we could not sleep tonight"
38,026-050,9,009-010,"And now we look upon the earth and sky"
102,101-125,21,021-025,"This spread of naked rock and peaks and moonlight is like a world ready to be born, a world that waits"
67,076-010,15,011-015,"It seems to us it asks a sign from us, a spark, a first commandment"
90,076-010,18,016-020,"We cannot know what word we are to give, nor what great deed this earth expects to witness"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"We know it waits"
88,076-010,20,016-020,"It seems to say it has great gifts to lay before us, but it wishes a greater gift for us"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"We are to speak"
86,076-010,18,016-020,"We are to give its goal, its highest meaning to all this glowing space of rock and sky"
106,101-125,21,021-025,"We look ahead, we beg our heart for guidance in answering this call no voice has spoken, yet we have heard"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"We look upon our hands"
90,076-010,17,016-020,"We see the dust of centuries, the dust which hid the great secrets and perhaps great evils"
77,076-010,15,011-015,"And yet it stirs no fear within our heart, but only silent reverence and pity"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"May knowledge come to us"
137,126-150,28,026-030,"What is the secret our heart has understood and yet will not reveal to us, although it seems to beat as if it were endeavoring to tell it"
4,000-010,2,000-002,"I am"
7,000-010,2,000-002,"I think"
6,000-010,2,000-002,"I will"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"My hands"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"My spirit"
6,000-010,2,000-002,"My sky"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"My forest"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"This earth of mine"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"What must I say besides"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"These are the words"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"This is the answer"
42,051-075,9,009-010,"I stand here on the summit of the mountain"
35,026-050,9,009-010,"I lift my head and I spread my arms"
54,051-075,12,011-015,"This, my body and spirit, this is the end of the quest"
38,026-050,8,006-008,"I wished to know the meaning of things"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"I am the meaning"
36,026-050,8,006-008,"I wished to find a warrant for being"
66,076-010,14,011-015,"I need no warrant for being, and no word of sanction upon my being"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"I am the warrant and the sanction"
76,076-010,17,016-020,"It is my eyes which see, and the sight of my eyes grants beauty to the earth"
80,076-010,18,016-020,"It is my ears which hear, and the hearing of my ears gives its song to the world"
104,101-125,21,021-025,"It is my mind which thinks, and the judgement of my mind is the only searchlight that can find the truth"
87,076-010,19,016-020,"It is my will which chooses, and the choice of my will is the only edict I must respect"
107,101-125,22,021-025,"Many words have been granted me, and some are wise, and some are false, but only three are holy: “I will it"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
107,101-125,20,016-020,"Whatever road I take, the guiding star is within me; the guiding star and the loadstone which point the way"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"They point in but one direction"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"They point to me"
118,101-125,28,026-030,"I know not if this earth on which I stand is the core of the universe or if it is but a speck of dust lost in eternity"
25,026-050,7,006-008,"I know not and I care not"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"For I know what happiness is possible to me on earth"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"And my happiness needs no higher aim to vindicate it"
40,026-050,9,009-010,"My happiness is not the means to any end"
13,011-025,4,003-005,"It is the end"
18,011-025,5,003-005,"It is its own goal"
21,011-025,5,003-005,"It is its own purpose"
63,076-010,13,011-015,"Neither am I the means to any end others may wish to accomplish"
29,026-050,8,006-008,"I am not a tool for their use"
33,026-050,8,006-008,"I am not a servant of their needs"
35,026-050,8,006-008,"I am not a bandage for their wounds"
36,026-050,8,006-008,"I am not a sacrifice on their altars"
10,011-025,4,003-005,"I am a man"
104,101-125,23,021-025,"This miracle of me is mine to own and keep, and mine to guard, and mine to use, and mine to kneel before"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"I do not surrender my treasures, nor do I share them"
121,101-125,27,026-030,"The fortune of my spirit is not to be blown into coins of brass and flung to the winds as alms for the poor of the spirit"
53,051-075,10,009-010,"I guard my treasures: my thought, my will, my freedom"
36,026-050,7,006-008,"And the greatest of these is freedom"
61,051-075,13,011-015,"I owe nothing to my brothers, nor do I gather debts from them"
55,051-075,14,011-015,"I ask none to live for me, nor do I live for any others"
53,051-075,12,011-015,"I covet no man’s soul, nor is my soul theirs to covet"
88,076-010,19,016-020,"I am neither foe nor friend to my brothers, but such as each of them shall deserve of me"
68,076-010,15,011-015,"And to earn my love, my brothers must do more than to have been born"
91,076-010,19,016-020,"I do not grant my love without reason, nor to any chance passer-by who may wish to claim it"
24,026-050,6,006-008,"I honor men with my love"
33,026-050,8,006-008,"But honor is a thing to be earned"
64,076-010,11,011-015,"I shall choose friends among men, but neither slaves nor masters"
106,101-125,21,021-025,"And I shall choose only such as please me, and them I shall love and respect, but neither command nor obey"
73,076-010,16,016-020,"And we shall join our hands when we wish, or walk alone when we so desire"
50,051-075,11,011-015,"For in the temple of his spirit, each man is alone"
52,051-075,9,009-010,"Let each man keep his temple untouched and undefiled"
84,076-010,16,016-020,"Then let him join hands with others if he wishes, but only beyond his holy threshold"
84,076-010,17,016-020,"For the word “We” must never be spoken, save by one’s choice and as a second thought"
178,176-200,35,031-035,"This word must never be placed first within man’s soul, else it becomes a monster, the root of all the evils on earth, the root of man’s torture by men, and of an unspeakable lie"
185,176-200,38,036-040,"The word “We” is as lime poured over men, which sets and hardens to stone, and crushes all beneath it, and that which is white and that which is black are lost equally in the grey of it"
164,151-175,34,031-035,"It is the word by which the depraved steal the virtue of the good, by which the weak steal the might of the strong, by which the fools steal the wisdom of the sages"
64,076-010,14,011-015,"What is my joy if all hands, even the unclean, can reach into it"
54,051-075,12,011-015,"What is my wisdom, if even the fools can dictate to me"
87,076-010,16,016-020,"What is my freedom, if all creatures, even the botched and the impotent, are my masters"
57,051-075,15,011-015,"What is my life, if I am but to bow, to agree and to obey"
43,051-075,9,009-010,"But I am done with this creed of corruption"
99,076-010,19,016-020,"I am done with the monster of “We,” the word of serfdom, of plunder, of misery, falsehood and shame"
177,176-200,38,036-040,"And now I see the face of god, and I raise this god over the earth, this god whom men have sought since men came into being, this god who will grant them joy and peace and pride"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"This god, this one word:"
2,000-010,1,000-002,"“I"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
84,076-010,21,021-025,"It was when I read the first of the books I found in my house that I saw the word “I"
103,101-125,22,021-025,"” And when I understood this word, the book fell from my hands, and I wept, I who had never known tears"
49,051-075,10,009-010,"I wept in deliverance and in pity for all mankind"
58,051-075,11,011-015,"I understood the blessed thing which I had called my curse"
113,101-125,24,021-025,"I understood why the best in me had been my sins and my transgressions; and why I had never felt guilt in my sins"
114,101-125,22,021-025,"I understood that centuries of chains and lashes will not kill the spirit of man nor the sense of truth within him"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"I read many books for many days"
83,076-010,19,016-020,"Then I called the Golden One, and I told her what I had read and what I had learned"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"She looked at me and the first words she spoke were:"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"“I love you"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"Then I said:"
61,051-075,13,011-015,"“My dearest one, it is not proper for men to be without names"
90,076-010,20,016-020,"There was a time when each man had a name of his own to distinguish him from all other men"
26,026-050,6,006-008,"So let us choose our names"
126,126-150,29,026-030,"I have read of a man who lived many thousands of years ago, and of all the names in these books, his is the one I wish to bear"
84,076-010,20,016-020,"He took the light of the gods and he brought it to men, and he taught men to be gods"
64,076-010,13,011-015,"And he suffered for his deed as all bearers of light must suffer"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"His name was Prometheus"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
44,051-075,9,009-010,"“It shall be your name,” said the Golden One"
92,076-010,21,021-025,"“And I have read of a goddess,” I said, “who was the mother of the earth and of all the gods"
17,011-025,4,003-005,"Her name was Gaea"
88,076-010,21,021-025,"Let this be your name, my Golden One, for you are to be the mother of a new kind of gods"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
42,051-075,9,009-010,"“It shall be my name,” said the Golden One"
16,011-025,4,003-005,"Now I look ahead"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"My future is clear before me"
254,251-275,54,051-055,"The Saint of the pyre had seen the future when he chose me as his heir, as the heir of all the saints and all the martyrs who came before him and who died for the same cause, for the same word, no matter what name they gave to their cause and their truth"
34,026-050,8,006-008,"I shall live here, in my own house"
63,076-010,15,011-015,"I shall take my food from the earth by the toil of my own hands"
40,026-050,8,006-008,"I shall learn many secrets from my books"
256,251-275,46,046-050,"Through the years ahead, I shall rebuild the achievements of the past, and open the way to carry them further, the achievements which are open to me, but closed forever to my brothers, for their minds are shackled to the weakest and dullest ones among them"
93,076-010,19,016-020,"I have learned that my power of the sky was known to men long ago; they called it Electricity"
53,051-075,9,009-010,"It was the power that moved their greatest inventions"
79,076-010,16,016-020,"It lit this house with light which came from those globes of glass on the walls"
49,051-075,9,009-010,"I have found the engine which produced this light"
60,051-075,14,011-015,"I shall learn how to repair it and how to make it work again"
57,051-075,12,011-015,"I shall learn how to use the wires which carry this power"
216,201-225,43,041-045,"Then I shall build a barrier of wires around my home, and across the paths which lead to my home; a barrier light as a cobweb, more impassable than a wall of granite; a barrier my brothers will never be able to cross"
77,076-010,15,011-015,"For they have nothing to fight me with, save the brute force of their numbers"
14,011-025,4,003-005,"I have my mind"
115,101-125,23,021-025,"Then here, on this mountaintop, with the world below me and nothing above me but the sun, I shall live my own truth"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"Gaea is pregnant with my child"
31,026-050,8,006-008,"Our son will be raised as a man"
56,051-075,14,011-015,"He will be taught to say “I” and to bear the pride of it"
54,051-075,12,011-015,"He will be taught to walk straight and on his own feet"
46,051-075,9,009-010,"He will be taught reverence for his own spirit"
183,176-200,39,036-040,"When I shall have read all the books and learned my new way, when my home will be ready and my earth tilled, I shall steal one day, for the last time, into the cursed City of my birth"
212,201-225,39,036-040,"I shall call to me my friend who has no name save International 4-8818, and all those like him, Fraternity 2-5503, who cries without reason, and Solidarity 9-6347 who calls for help in the night, and a few others"
137,126-150,28,026-030,"I shall call to me all the men and the women whose spirit has not been killed within them and who suffer under the yoke of their brothers"
56,051-075,12,011-015,"They will follow me and I shall lead them to my fortress"
146,126-150,25,021-025,"And here, in this uncharted wilderness, I and they, my chosen friends, my fellow-builders, shall write the first chapter in the new history of man"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"These are the things before me"
76,076-010,18,016-020,"And as I stand here at the door of glory, I look behind me for the last time"
81,076-010,17,016-020,"I look upon the history of men, which I have learned from the books, and I wonder"
82,076-010,17,016-020,"It was a long story, and the spirit which moved it was the spirit of man’s freedom"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"But what is freedom"
17,011-025,3,003-005,"Freedom from what"
70,076-010,14,011-015,"There is nothing to take a man’s freedom away from him, save other men"
46,051-075,11,011-015,"To be free, a man must be free of his brothers"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"That is freedom"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"That and nothing else"
38,026-050,8,006-008,"At first, man was enslaved by the gods"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"But he broke their chains"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"Then he was enslaved by the kings"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"But he broke their chains"
53,051-075,12,011-015,"He was enslaved by his birth, by his kin, by his race"
25,026-050,5,003-005,"But he broke their chains"
224,201-225,46,046-050,"He declared to all his brothers that a man has rights which neither god nor king nor other men can take away from him, no matter what their number, for his is the right of man, and there is no right on earth above this right"
109,101-125,21,021-025,"And he stood on the threshold of the freedom for which the blood of the centuries behind him had been spilled"
76,076-010,16,016-020,"But then he gave up all he had won, and fell lower than his savage beginning"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"What brought it to pass"
45,051-075,8,006-008,"What disaster took their reason away from men"
60,051-075,11,011-015,"What whip lashed them to their knees in shame and submission"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"The worship of the word “We"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"”"
264,251-275,49,046-050,"When men accepted that worship, the structure of centuries collapsed about them, the structure whose every beam had come from the thought of some one man, each in his day down the ages, from the depth of some one spirit, such spirit as existed but for its own sake"
190,176-200,33,031-035,"Those men who survived those eager to obey, eager to live for one another, since they had nothing else to vindicate them—those men could neither carry on, nor preserve what they had received"
61,051-075,11,011-015,"Thus did all thought, all science, all wisdom perish on earth"
177,176-200,31,031-035,"Thus did men—men with nothing to offer save their great number—lost the steel towers, the flying ships, the power wires, all the things they had not created and could never keep"
164,151-175,29,026-030,"Perhaps, later, some men had been born with the mind and the courage to recover these things which were lost; perhaps these men came before the Councils of Scholars"
67,076-010,12,011-015,"They were answered as I have been answered—and for the same reasons"
190,176-200,35,031-035,"But I still wonder how it was possible, in those graceless years of transition, long ago, that men did not see whither they were going, and went on, in blindness and cowardice, to their fate"
118,101-125,27,026-030,"I wonder, for it is hard for me to conceive how men who knew the word “I” could give it up and not know what they lost"
133,126-150,28,026-030,"But such has been the story, for I have lived in the City of the damned, and I know what horror men permitted to be brought upon them"
123,101-125,24,021-025,"Perhaps, in those days, there were a few among men, a few of clear sight and clean soul, who refused to surrender that word"
85,076-010,16,016-020,"What agony must have been theirs before that which they saw coming and could not stop"
48,051-075,9,009-010,"Perhaps they cried out in protest and in warning"
37,026-050,8,006-008,"But men paid no heed to their warning"
110,101-125,19,016-020,"And they, these few, fought a hopeless battle, and they perished with their banners smeared by their own blood"
39,026-050,8,006-008,"And they chose to perish, for they knew"
59,051-075,12,011-015,"To them, I send my salute across the centuries, and my pity"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"Theirs is the banner in my hand"
130,126-150,28,026-030,"And I wish I had the power to tell them that the despair of their hearts was not to be final, and their night was not without hope"
42,051-075,9,009-010,"For the battle they lost can never be lost"
49,051-075,10,009-010,"For that which they died to save can never perish"
123,101-125,23,021-025,"Through all the darkness, through all the shame of which men are capable, the spirit of man will remain alive on this earth"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"It may sleep, but it will awaken"
45,051-075,9,009-010,"It may wear chains, but it will break through"
18,011-025,5,003-005,"And man will go on"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"Man, not men"
96,076-010,20,016-020,"Here on this mountain, I and my sons and my chosen friends shall build our new land and our fort"
108,101-125,21,021-025,"And it will become as the heart of the earth, lost and hidden at first, but beating, beating louder each day"
51,051-075,11,011-015,"And word of it will reach every corner of the earth"
110,101-125,22,021-025,"And the roads of the world will become as veins which will carry the best of the world’s blood to my threshold"
107,101-125,21,021-025,"And all my brothers, and the Councils of my brothers, will hear of it, but they will be impotent against me"
207,201-225,44,041-045,"And the day will come when I shall break all the chains of the earth, and raze the cities of the enslaved, and my home will become the capital of a world where each man will be free to exist for his own sake"
77,076-010,17,016-020,"For the coming of that day shall I fight, I and my sons and my chosen friends"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"For the freedom of Man"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"For his rights"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"For his life"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"For his honor"
111,101-125,25,021-025,"And here, over the portals of my fort, I shall cut in the stone the word which is to be my beacon and my banner"
59,051-075,12,011-015,"The word which will not die, should we all perish in battle"
99,076-010,22,021-025,"The word which can never die on this earth, for it is the heart of it and the meaning and the glory"
16,011-025,3,003-005,"The sacred word:"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"EGO"
298,more,49,046-050,"Among the few features of agricultural England which retain an appearance but little modified by the lapse of centuries, may be reckoned the high, grassy and furzy downs, coombs, or ewe-leases, as they are indifferently called, that fill a large area of certain counties in the south and south-west"
118,101-125,22,021-025,"If any mark of human occupation is met with hereon, it usually takes the form of the solitary cottage of some shepherd"
98,076-010,19,016-020,"Fifty years ago such a lonely cottage stood on such a down, and may possibly be standing there now"
117,101-125,20,016-020,"In spite of its loneliness, however, the spot, by actual measurement, was not more than five miles from a county-town"
27,026-050,5,003-005,"Yet that affected it little"
337,more,52,051-055,"Five miles of irregular upland, during the long inimical seasons, with their sleets, snows, rains, and mists, afford withdrawing space enough to isolate a Timon or a Nebuchadnezzar; much less, in fair weather, to please that less repellent tribe, the poets, philosophers, artists, and others who ‘conceive and meditate of pleasant things"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
174,151-175,30,026-030,"Some old earthen camp or barrow, some clump of trees, at least some starved fragment of ancient hedge is usually taken advantage of in the erection of these forlorn dwellings"
69,076-010,13,011-015,"But, in the present case, such a kind of shelter had been disregarded"
79,076-010,12,011-015,"Higher Crowstairs, as the house was called, stood quite detached and undefended"
177,176-200,33,031-035,"The only reason for its precise situation seemed to be the crossing of two footpaths at right angles hard by, which may have crossed there and thus for a good five hundred years"
56,051-075,11,011-015,"Hence the house was exposed to the elements on all sides"
242,226-250,46,046-050,"But, though the wind up here blew unmistakably when it did blow, and the rain hit hard whenever it fell, the various weathers of the winter season were not quite so formidable on the coomb as they were imagined to be by dwellers on low ground"
94,076-010,18,016-020,"The raw rimes were not so pernicious as in the hollows, and the frosts were scarcely so severe"
281,more,48,046-050,"When the shepherd and his family who tenanted the house were pitied for their sufferings from the exposure, they said that upon the whole they were less inconvenienced by ‘wuzzes and flames’ (hoarses and phlegms) than when they had lived by the stream of a snug neighbouring valley"
124,101-125,22,021-025,"The night of March 28, 182-, was precisely one of the nights that were wont to call forth these expressions of commiseration"
97,076-010,16,016-020,"The level rainstorm smote walls, slopes, and hedges like the clothyard shafts of Senlac and Crecy"
195,176-200,34,031-035,"Such sheep and outdoor animals as had no shelter stood with their buttocks to the winds; while the tails of little birds trying to roost on some scraggy thorn were blown inside-out like umbrellas"
98,076-010,16,016-020,"The gable-end of the cottage was stained with wet, and the eavesdroppings flapped against the wall"
59,051-075,9,009-010,"Yet never was commiseration for the shepherd more misplaced"
110,101-125,18,016-020,"For that cheerful rustic was entertaining a large party in glorification of the christening of his second girl"
129,126-150,25,021-025,"The guests had arrived before the rain began to fall, and they were all now assembled in the chief or living room of the dwelling"
192,176-200,35,031-035,"A glance into the apartment at eight o’clock on this eventful evening would have resulted in the opinion that it was as cosy and comfortable a nook as could be wished for in boisterous weather"
330,more,52,051-055,"The calling of its inhabitant was proclaimed by a number of highly-polished sheep-crooks without stems that were hung ornamentally over the fireplace, the curl of each shining crook varying from the antiquated type engraved in the patriarchal pictures of old family Bibles to the most approved fashion of the last local sheep-fair"
202,201-225,32,031-035,"The room was lighted by half-a-dozen candles, having wicks only a trifle smaller than the grease which enveloped them, in candlesticks that were never used but at high-days, holy-days, and family feasts"
83,076-010,14,011-015,"The lights were scattered about the room, two of them standing on the chimney-piece"
50,051-075,8,006-008,"This position of candles was in itself significant"
49,051-075,8,006-008,"Candles on the chimney-piece always meant a party"
128,126-150,24,021-025,"On the hearth, in front of a back-brand to give substance, blazed a fire of thorns, that crackled ‘like the laughter of the fool"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
35,026-050,5,003-005,"Nineteen persons were gathered here"
573,more,91,more,"Of these, five women, wearing gowns of various bright hues, sat in chairs along the wall; girls shy and not shy filled the window-bench; four men, including Charley Jake the hedge-carpenter, Elijah New the parish-clerk, and John Pitcher, a neighbouring dairyman, the shepherd’s father-in-law, lolled in the settle; a young man and maid, who were blushing over tentative pourparlers on a life-companionship, sat beneath the corner-cupboard; and an elderly engaged man of fifty or upward moved restlessly about from spots where his betrothed was not to the spot where she was"
109,101-125,16,016-020,"Enjoyment was pretty general, and so much the more prevailed in being unhampered by conventional restrictions"
426,more,72,more,"Absolute confidence in each other’s good opinion begat perfect ease, while the finishing stroke of manner, amounting to a truly princely serenity, was lent to the majority by the absence of any expression or trait denoting that they wished to get on in the world, enlarge their minds, or do any eclipsing thing whatever—which nowadays so generally nips the bloom and bonhomie of all except the two extremes of the social scale"
235,226-250,41,041-045,"Shepherd Fennel had married well, his wife being a dairyman’s daughter from a vale at a distance, who brought fifty guineas in her pocket—and kept them there, till they should be required for ministering to the needs of a coming family"
103,101-125,18,016-020,"This frugal woman had been somewhat exercised as to the character that should be given to the gathering"
216,201-225,39,036-040,"A sit-still party had its advantages; but an undisturbed position of ease in chairs and settles was apt to lead on the men to such an unconscionable deal of toping that they would sometimes fairly drink the house dry"
268,251-275,41,041-045,"A dancing-party was the alternative; but this, while avoiding the foregoing objection on the score of good drink, had a counterbalancing disadvantage in the matter of good victuals, the ravenous appetites engendered by the exercise causing immense havoc in the buttery"
168,151-175,28,026-030,"Shepherdess Fennel fell back upon the intermediate plan of mingling short dances with short periods of talk and singing, so as to hinder any ungovernable rage in either"
149,126-150,26,026-030,"But this scheme was entirely confined to her own gentle mind: the shepherd himself was in the mood to exhibit the most reckless phases of hospitality"
307,more,57,056-060,"The fiddler was a boy of those parts, about twelve years of age, who had a wonderful dexterity in jigs and reels, though his fingers were so small and short as to necessitate a constant shifting for the high notes, from which he scrambled back to the first position with sounds not of unmixed purity of tone"
216,201-225,32,031-035,"At seven the shrill tweedle-dee of this youngster had begun, accompanied by a booming ground-bass from Elijah New, the parish-clerk, who had thoughtfully brought with him his favourite musical instrument, the serpent"
30,026-050,4,003-005,"Dancing was instantaneous, Mrs"
111,101-125,21,021-025,"Fennel privately enjoining the players on no account to let the dance exceed the length of a quarter of an hour"
88,076-010,15,011-015,"But Elijah and the boy, in the excitement of their position, quite forgot the injunction"
259,251-275,47,046-050,"Moreover, Oliver Giles, a man of seventeen, one of the dancers, who was enamoured of his partner, a fair girl of thirty-three rolling years, had recklessly handed a new crown-piece to the musicians, as a bribe to keep going as long as they had muscle and wind"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"Mrs"
162,151-175,28,026-030,"Fennel, seeing the steam begin to generate on the countenances of her guests, crossed over and touched the fiddler’s elbow and put her hand on the serpent’s mouth"
156,151-175,28,026-030,"But they took no notice, and fearing she might lose her character of genial hostess if she were to interfere too markedly, she retired and sat down helpless"
261,251-275,44,041-045,"And so the dance whizzed on with cumulative fury, the performers moving in their planet-like courses, direct and retrograde, from apogee to perigee, till the hand of the well-kicked clock at the bottom of the room had travelled over the circumference of an hour"
184,176-200,28,026-030,"While these cheerful events were in course of enactment within Fennel’s pastoral dwelling, an incident having considerable bearing on the party had occurred in the gloomy night without"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"Mrs"
203,201-225,35,031-035,"Fennel’s concern about the growing fierceness of the dance corresponded in point of time with the ascent of a human figure to the solitary hill of Higher Crowstairs from the direction of the distant town"
153,151-175,24,021-025,"This personage strode on through the rain without a pause, following the little-worn path which, further on in its course, skirted the shepherd’s cottage"
173,151-175,32,031-035,"It was nearly the time of full moon, and on this account, though the sky was lined with a uniform sheet of dripping cloud, ordinary objects out of doors were readily visible"
252,251-275,45,041-045,"The sad wan light revealed the lonely pedestrian to be a man of supple frame; his gait suggested that he had somewhat passed the period of perfect and instinctive agility, though not so far as to be otherwise than rapid of motion when occasion required"
61,051-075,13,011-015,"At a rough guess, he might have been about forty years of age"
236,226-250,41,041-045,"He appeared tall, but a recruiting sergeant, or other person accustomed to the judging of men’s heights by the eye, would have discerned that this was chiefly owing to his gauntness, and that he was not more than five-feet-eight or nine"
317,more,59,056-060,"Notwithstanding the regularity of his tread, there was caution in it, as in that of one who mentally feels his way; and despite the fact that it was not a black coat nor a dark garment of any sort that he wore, there was something about him which suggested that he naturally belonged to the black-coated tribes of men"
151,151-175,24,021-025,"His clothes were of fustian, and his boots hobnailed, yet in his progress he showed not the mud-accustomed bearing of hobnailed and fustianed peasantry"
142,126-150,25,021-025,"By the time that he had arrived abreast of the shepherd’s premises the rain came down, or rather came along, with yet more determined violence"
118,101-125,21,021-025,"The outskirts of the little settlement partially broke the force of wind and rain, and this induced him to stand still"
248,226-250,40,036-040,"The most salient of the shepherd’s domestic erections was an empty sty at the forward corner of his hedgeless garden, for in these latitudes the principle of masking the homelier features of your establishment by a conventional frontage was unknown"
110,101-125,20,016-020,"The traveller’s eye was attracted to this small building by the pallid shine of the wet slates that covered it"
77,076-010,13,011-015,"He turned aside, and, finding it empty, stood under the pent-roof for shelter"
423,more,79,more,"While he stood, the boom of the serpent within the adjacent house, and the lesser strains of the fiddler, reached the spot as an accompaniment to the surging hiss of the flying rain on the sod, its louder beating on the cabbage-leaves of the garden, on the eight or ten beehives just discernible by the path, and its dripping from the eaves into a row of buckets and pans that had been placed under the walls of the cottage"
231,226-250,37,036-040,"For at Higher Crowstairs, as at all such elevated domiciles, the grand difficulty of housekeeping was an insufficiency of water; and a casual rainfall was utilized by turning out, as catchers, every utensil that the house contained"
173,151-175,27,026-030,"Some queer stories might be told of the contrivances for economy in suds and dish-waters that are absolutely necessitated in upland habitations during the droughts of summer"
131,126-150,23,021-025,"But at this season there were no such exigencies; a mere acceptance of what the skies bestowed was sufficient for an abundant store"
64,076-010,13,011-015,"At last the notes of the serpent ceased and the house was silent"
204,201-225,34,031-035,"This cessation of activity aroused the solitary pedestrian from the reverie into which he had lapsed, and, emerging from the shed, with an apparently new intention, he walked up the path to the house-door"
137,126-150,28,026-030,"Arrived here, his first act was to kneel down on a large stone beside the row of vessels, and to drink a copious draught from one of them"
103,101-125,20,016-020,"Having quenched his thirst he rose and lifted his hand to knock, but paused with his eye upon the panel"
282,more,51,051-055,"Since the dark surface of the wood revealed absolutely nothing, it was evident that he must be mentally looking through the door, as if he wished to measure thereby all the possibilities that a house of this sort might include, and how they might bear upon the question of his entry"
57,051-075,10,009-010,"In his indecision he turned and surveyed the scene around"
31,026-050,6,006-008,"Not a soul was anywhere visible"
343,more,61,more,"The garden-path stretched downward from his feet, gleaming like the track of a snail; the roof of the little well (mostly dry), the well-cover, the top rail of the garden-gate, were varnished with the same dull liquid glaze; while, far away in the vale, a faint whiteness of more than usual extent showed that the rivers were high in the meads"
161,151-175,26,026-030,"Beyond all this winked a few bleared lamplights through the beating drops—lights that denoted the situation of the county-town from which he had appeared to come"
110,101-125,21,021-025,"The absence of all notes of life in that direction seemed to clinch his intentions, and he knocked at the door"
74,076-010,13,011-015,"Within, a desultory chat had taken the place of movement and musical sound"
160,151-175,26,026-030,"The hedge-carpenter was suggesting a song to the company, which nobody just then was inclined to undertake, so that the knock afforded a not unwelcome diversion"
8,000-010,2,000-002,"‘Walk in"
28,026-050,5,003-005,"’ said the shepherd promptly"
88,076-010,15,011-015,"The latch clicked upward, and out of the night our pedestrian appeared upon the door-mat"
81,076-010,15,011-015,"The shepherd arose, snuffed two of the nearest candles, and turned to look at him"
100,076-010,16,016-020,"Their light disclosed that the stranger was dark in complexion and not unprepossessing as to feature"
189,176-200,35,031-035,"His hat, which for a moment he did not remove, hung low over his eyes, without concealing that they were large, open, and determined, moving with a flash rather than a glance round the room"
167,151-175,33,031-035,"He seemed pleased with his survey, and, baring his shaggy head, said, in a rich deep voice, ‘The rain is so heavy, friends, that I ask leave to come in and rest awhile"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
41,051-075,7,006-008,"‘To be sure, stranger,’ said the shepherd"
196,176-200,40,036-040,"‘And faith, you’ve been lucky in choosing your time, for we are having a bit of a fling for a glad cause—though, to be sure, a man could hardly wish that glad cause to happen more than once a year"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"‘Nor less,’ spoke up a woman"
120,101-125,28,026-030,"‘For ’tis best to get your family over and done with, as soon as you can, so as to be all the earlier out of the fag o’t"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"‘And what may be this glad cause"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"’ asked the stranger"
44,051-075,7,006-008,"‘A birth and christening,’ said the shepherd"
176,176-200,35,031-035,"The stranger hoped his host might not be made unhappy either by too many or too few of such episodes, and being invited by a gesture to a pull at the mug, he readily acquiesced"
109,101-125,19,016-020,"His manner, which, before entering, had been so dubious, was now altogether that of a careless and candid man"
44,051-075,7,006-008,"‘Late to be traipsing athwart this coomb—hey"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"’ said the engaged man of fifty"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"‘Late it is, master, as you say"
146,126-150,30,026-030,"—I’ll take a seat in the chimney-corner, if you have nothing to urge against it, ma’am; for I am a little moist on the side that was next the rain"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
3,000-010,1,000-002,"Mrs"
206,201-225,33,031-035,"Shepherd Fennel assented, and made room for the self-invited comer, who, having got completely inside the chimney-corner, stretched out his legs and his arms with the expansiveness of a person quite at home"
153,151-175,30,026-030,"‘Yes, I am rather cracked in the vamp,’ he said freely, seeing that the eyes of the shepherd’s wife fell upon his boots, ‘and I am not well fitted either"
174,151-175,37,036-040,"I have had some rough times lately, and have been forced to pick up what I can get in the way of wearing, but I must find a suit better fit for working-days when I reach home"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
18,011-025,3,003-005,"‘One of hereabouts"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"’ she inquired"
38,026-050,6,006-008,"‘Not quite that—further up the country"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"‘I thought so"
62,076-010,13,011-015,"And so be I; and by your tongue you come from my neighbourhood"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
56,051-075,11,011-015,"‘But you would hardly have heard of me,’ he said quickly"
51,051-075,10,009-010,"‘My time would be long before yours, ma’am, you see"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
98,076-010,15,011-015,"This testimony to the youthfulness of his hostess had the effect of stopping her cross-examination"
79,076-010,14,011-015,"‘There is only one thing more wanted to make me happy,’ continued the new-comer"
64,076-010,16,016-020,"‘And that is a little baccy, which I am sorry to say I am out of"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
40,026-050,7,006-008,"‘I’ll fill your pipe,’ said the shepherd"
42,051-075,10,009-010,"‘I must ask you to lend me a pipe likewise"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
32,026-050,7,006-008,"‘A smoker, and no pipe about ‘ee"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
40,026-050,8,006-008,"‘I have dropped it somewhere on the road"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
135,126-150,27,026-030,"The shepherd filled and handed him a new clay pipe, saying, as he did so, ‘Hand me your baccy-box—I’ll fill that too, now I am about it"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
58,051-075,10,009-010,"The man went through the movement of searching his pockets"
14,011-025,3,003-005,"‘Lost that too"
42,051-075,7,006-008,"’ said his entertainer, with some surprise"
50,051-075,10,009-010,"‘I am afraid so,’ said the man with some confusion"
34,026-050,9,009-010,"‘Give it to me in a screw of paper"
216,201-225,45,041-045,"’  Lighting his pipe at the candle with a suction that drew the whole flame into the bowl, he resettled himself in the corner and bent his looks upon the faint steam from his damp legs, as if he wished to say no more"
192,176-200,35,031-035,"Meanwhile the general body of guests had been taking little notice of this visitor by reason of an absorbing discussion in which they were engaged with the band about a tune for the next dance"
121,101-125,23,021-025,"The matter being settled, they were about to stand up when an interruption came in the shape of another knock at the door"
205,201-225,40,036-040,"At sound of the same the man in the chimney-corner took up the poker and began stirring the brands as if doing it thoroughly were the one aim of his existence; and a second time the shepherd said, ‘Walk in"
62,076-010,12,011-015,"’  In a moment another man stood upon the straw-woven door-mat"
21,011-025,5,003-005,"He too was a stranger"
68,076-010,12,011-015,"This individual was one of a type radically different from the first"
107,101-125,18,016-020,"There was more of the commonplace in his manner, and a certain jovial cosmopolitanism sat upon his features"
147,126-150,25,021-025,"He was several years older than the first arrival, his hair being slightly frosted, his eyebrows bristly, and his whiskers cut back from his cheeks"
87,076-010,17,016-020,"His face was rather full and flabby, and yet it was not altogether a face without power"
56,051-075,9,009-010,"A few grog-blossoms marked the neighbourhood of his nose"
232,226-250,41,041-045,"He flung back his long drab greatcoat, revealing that beneath it he wore a suit of cinder-gray shade throughout, large heavy seals, of some metal or other that would take a polish, dangling from his fob as his only personal ornament"
176,176-200,32,031-035,"Shaking the water-drops from his low-crowned glazed hat, he said, ‘I must ask for a few minutes’ shelter, comrades, or I shall be wetted to my skin before I get to Casterbridge"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
109,101-125,18,016-020,"‘Make yourself at home, master,’ said the shepherd, perhaps a trifle less heartily than on the first occasion"
260,251-275,43,041-045,"Not that Fennel had the least tinge of niggardliness in his composition; but the room was far from large, spare chairs were not numerous, and damp companions were not altogether desirable at close quarters for the women and girls in their bright-coloured gowns"
204,201-225,39,036-040,"However, the second comer, after taking off his greatcoat, and hanging his hat on a nail in one of the ceiling-beams as if he had been specially invited to put it there, advanced and sat down at the table"
251,251-275,44,041-045,"This had been pushed so closely into the chimney-corner, to give all available room to the dancers, that its inner edge grazed the elbow of the man who had ensconced himself by the fire; and thus the two strangers were brought into close companionship"
375,more,67,more,"They nodded to each other by way of breaking the ice of unacquaintance, and the first stranger handed his neighbour the family mug—a huge vessel of brown ware, having its upper edge worn away like a threshold by the rub of whole generations of thirsty lips that had gone the way of all flesh, and bearing the following inscription burnt upon its rotund side in yellow letters"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"THERE IS NO FUN"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"UNTiLL i CUM"
289,more,52,051-055,"The other man, nothing loth, raised the mug to his lips, and drank on, and on, and on—till a curious blueness overspread the countenance of the shepherd’s wife, who had regarded with no little surprise the first stranger’s free offer to the second of what did not belong to him to dispense"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"‘I knew it"
55,051-075,10,009-010,"’ said the toper to the shepherd with much satisfaction"
169,151-175,32,031-035,"‘When I walked up your garden before coming in, and saw the hives all of a row, I said to myself; “Where there’s bees there’s honey, and where there’s honey there’s mead"
100,076-010,22,021-025,"”  But mead of such a truly comfortable sort as this I really didn’t expect to meet in my older days"
76,076-010,16,016-020,"’  He took yet another pull at the mug, till it assumed an ominous elevation"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"‘Glad you enjoy it"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"’ said the shepherd warmly"
34,026-050,6,006-008,"‘It is goodish mead,’ assented Mrs"
130,126-150,25,021-025,"Fennel, with an absence of enthusiasm which seemed to say that it was possible to buy praise for one’s cellar at too heavy a price"
78,076-010,15,011-015,"‘It is trouble enough to make—and really I hardly think we shall make any more"
131,126-150,24,021-025,"For honey sells well, and we ourselves can make shift with a drop o’ small mead and metheglin for common use from the comb-washings"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
35,026-050,7,006-008,"‘O, but you’ll never have the heart"
113,101-125,20,016-020,"’ reproachfully cried the stranger in cinder-gray, after taking up the mug a third time and setting it down empty"
120,101-125,27,026-030,"‘I love mead, when ’tis old like this, as I love to go to church o’ Sundays, or to relieve the needy any day of the week"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
11,011-025,3,003-005,"‘Ha, ha, ha"
184,176-200,33,031-035,"’ said the man in the chimney-corner, who, in spite of the taciturnity induced by the pipe of tobacco, could not or would not refrain from this slight testimony to his comrade’s humour"
323,more,53,051-055,"Now the old mead of those days, brewed of the purest first-year or maiden honey, four pounds to the gallon—with its due complement of white of eggs, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, mace, rosemary, yeast, and processes of working, bottling, and cellaring—tasted remarkably strong; but it did not taste so strong as it actually was"
211,201-225,34,031-035,"Hence, presently, the stranger in cinder-gray at the table, moved by its creeping influence, unbuttoned his waistcoat, threw himself back in his chair, spread his legs, and made his presence felt in various ways"
94,076-010,18,016-020,"‘Well, well, as I say,’ he resumed, ‘I am going to Casterbridge, and to Casterbridge I must go"
112,101-125,23,021-025,"I should have been almost there by this time; but the rain drove me into your dwelling, and I’m not sorry for it"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
31,026-050,5,003-005,"‘You don’t live in Casterbridge"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"’ said the shepherd"
48,051-075,10,009-010,"‘Not as yet; though I shortly mean to move there"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"‘Going to set up in trade, perhaps"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
34,026-050,6,006-008,"‘No, no,’ said the shepherd’s wife"
81,076-010,17,016-020,"‘It is easy to see that the gentleman is rich, and don’t want to work at anything"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
101,101-125,16,016-020,"The cinder-gray stranger paused, as if to consider whether he would accept that definition of himself"
79,076-010,15,011-015,"He presently rejected it by answering, ‘Rich is not quite the word for me, dame"
26,026-050,7,006-008,"I do work, and I must work"
101,101-125,19,016-020,"And even if I only get to Casterbridge by midnight I must begin work there at eight to-morrow morning"
84,076-010,17,016-020,"Yes, het or wet, blow or snow, famine or sword, my day’s work to-morrow must be done"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
9,011-025,2,000-002,"‘Poor man"
51,051-075,11,011-015,"Then, in spite o’ seeming, you be worse off than we"
29,026-050,5,003-005,"’ replied the shepherd’s wife"
45,051-075,9,009-010,"‘’Tis the nature of my trade, men and maidens"
48,051-075,10,009-010,"’Tis the nature of my trade more than my poverty"
77,076-010,18,016-020,"But really and truly I must up and off, or I shan’t get a lodging in the town"
170,151-175,34,031-035,"’  However, the speaker did not move, and directly added, ‘There’s time for one more draught of friendship before I go; and I’d perform it at once if the mug were not dry"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
33,026-050,7,006-008,"‘Here’s a mug o’ small,’ said Mrs"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Fennel"
75,076-010,16,016-020,"‘Small, we call it, though to be sure ’tis only the first wash o’ the combs"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
36,026-050,5,003-005,"‘No,’ said the stranger disdainfully"
62,076-010,11,011-015,"‘I won’t spoil your first kindness by partaking o’ your second"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
32,026-050,5,003-005,"‘Certainly not,’ broke in Fennel"
70,076-010,13,011-015,"‘We don’t increase and multiply every day, and I’ll fill the mug again"
73,076-010,16,016-020,"’  He went away to the dark place under the stairs where the barrel stood"
28,026-050,4,003-005,"The shepherdess followed him"
23,026-050,5,003-005,"‘Why should you do this"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"’ she said reproachfully, as soon as they were alone"
145,126-150,28,026-030,"‘He’s emptied it once, though it held enough for ten people; and now he’s not contented wi’ the small, but must needs call for more o’ the strong"
37,026-050,8,006-008,"And a stranger unbeknown to any of us"
52,051-075,13,011-015,"For my part, I don’t like the look o’ the man at all"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
73,076-010,15,011-015,"‘But he’s in the house, my honey; and ’tis a wet night, and a christening"
42,051-075,10,009-010,"Daze it, what’s a cup of mead more or less"
40,026-050,6,006-008,"There’ll be plenty more next bee-burning"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
74,076-010,11,011-015,"‘Very well—this time, then,’ she answered, looking wistfully at the barrel"
100,076-010,22,021-025,"‘But what is the man’s calling, and where is he one of; that he should come in and join us like this"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"‘I don’t know"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"I’ll ask him again"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
137,126-150,24,021-025,"The catastrophe of having the mug drained dry at one pull by the stranger in cinder-gray was effectually guarded against this time by Mrs"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"Fennel"
98,076-010,19,016-020,"She poured out his allowance in a small cup, keeping the large one at a discreet distance from him"
99,076-010,16,016-020,"When he had tossed off his portion the shepherd renewed his inquiry about the stranger’s occupation"
154,151-175,23,021-025,"The latter did not immediately reply, and the man in the chimney-corner, with sudden demonstrativeness, said, ‘Anybody may know my trade—I’m a wheelwright"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
54,051-075,10,009-010,"‘A very good trade for these parts,’ said the shepherd"
97,076-010,17,016-020,"‘And anybody may know mine—if they’ve the sense to find it out,’ said the stranger in cinder-gray"
107,101-125,19,016-020,"‘You may generally tell what a man is by his claws,’ observed the hedge-carpenter, looking at his own hands"
65,076-010,14,011-015,"‘My fingers be as full of thorns as an old pin-cushion is of pins"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
124,101-125,23,021-025,"The hands of the man in the chimney-corner instinctively sought the shade, and he gazed into the fire as he resumed his pipe"
188,176-200,36,036-040,"The man at the table took up the hedge-carpenter’s remark, and added smartly, ‘True; but the oddity of my trade is that, instead of setting a mark upon me, it sets a mark upon my customers"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
118,101-125,20,016-020,"No observation being offered by anybody in elucidation of this enigma, the shepherd’s wife once more called for a song"
117,101-125,19,016-020,"The same obstacles presented themselves as at the former time—one had no voice, another had forgotten the first verse"
170,151-175,29,026-030,"The stranger at the table, whose soul had now risen to a good working temperature, relieved the difficulty by exclaiming that, to start the company, he would sing himself"
182,176-200,30,026-030,"Thrusting one thumb into the arm-hole of his waistcoat, he waved the other hand in the air, and, with an extemporizing gaze at the shining sheep-crooks above the mantelpiece, began:-"
33,026-050,8,006-008,"‘O my trade it is the rarest one,"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"Simple shepherds all -"
27,026-050,7,006-008,"My trade is a sight to see;"
49,051-075,11,011-015,"For my customers I tie, and take them up on high,"
30,026-050,7,006-008,"And waft ’em to a far countree"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
144,126-150,25,021-025,"The room was silent when he had finished the verse—with one exception, that of the man in the chimney-corner, who, at the singer’s word, ‘Chorus"
52,051-075,11,011-015,"‘joined him in a deep bass voice of musical relish -"
31,026-050,7,006-008,"‘And waft ’em to a far countree"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
171,151-175,30,026-030,"Oliver Giles, John Pitcher the dairyman, the parish-clerk, the engaged man of fifty, the row of young women against the wall, seemed lost in thought not of the gayest kind"
259,251-275,42,041-045,"The shepherd looked meditatively on the ground, the shepherdess gazed keenly at the singer, and with some suspicion; she was doubting whether this stranger were merely singing an old song from recollection, or was composing one there and then for the occasion"
180,176-200,29,026-030,"All were as perplexed at the obscure revelation as the guests at Belshazzar’s Feast, except the man in the chimney-corner, who quietly said, ‘Second verse, stranger,’ and smoked on"
110,101-125,18,016-020,"The singer thoroughly moistened himself from his lips inwards, and went on with the next stanza as requested:-"
30,026-050,6,006-008,"‘My tools are but common ones,"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"Simple shepherds all -"
29,026-050,7,006-008,"My tools are no sight to see:"
52,051-075,10,009-010,"A little hempen string, and a post whereon to swing,"
28,026-050,5,003-005,"Are implements enough for me"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
29,026-050,4,003-005,"Shepherd Fennel glanced round"
87,076-010,14,011-015,"There was no longer any doubt that the stranger was answering his question rhythmically"
64,076-010,10,009-010,"The guests one and all started back with suppressed exclamations"
163,151-175,28,026-030,"The young woman engaged to the man of fifty fainted half-way, and would have proceeded, but finding him wanting in alacrity for catching her she sat down trembling"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"‘O, he’s the—"
90,076-010,15,011-015,"’ whispered the people in the background, mentioning the name of an ominous public officer"
19,011-025,5,003-005,"‘He’s come to do it"
385,more,67,more,"’Tis to be at Casterbridge jail to-morrow—the man for sheep-stealing—the poor clock-maker we heard of; who used to live away at Shottsford and had no work to do—Timothy Summers, whose family were a-starving, and so he went out of Shottsford by the high-road, and took a sheep in open daylight, defying the farmer and the farmer’s wife and the farmer’s lad, and every man jack among ’em"
277,more,54,051-055,"He’ (and they nodded towards the stranger of the deadly trade) ‘is come from up the country to do it because there’s not enough to do in his own county-town, and he’s got the place here now our own county man’s dead; he’s going to live in the same cottage under the prison wall"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
110,101-125,18,016-020,"The stranger in cinder-gray took no notice of this whispered string of observations, but again wetted his lips"
185,176-200,33,031-035,"Seeing that his friend in the chimney-corner was the only one who reciprocated his joviality in any way, he held out his cup towards that appreciative comrade, who also held out his own"
89,076-010,16,016-020,"They clinked together, the eyes of the rest of the room hanging upon the singer’s actions"
98,076-010,19,016-020,"He parted his lips for the third verse; but at that moment another knock was audible upon the door"
44,051-075,8,006-008,"This time the knock was faint and hesitating"
232,226-250,37,036-040,"The company seemed scared; the shepherd looked with consternation towards the entrance, and it was with some effort that he resisted his alarmed wife’s deprecatory glance, and uttered for the third time the welcoming words, ‘Walk in"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
62,076-010,12,011-015,"The door was gently opened, and another man stood upon the mat"
51,051-075,10,009-010,"He, like those who had preceded him, was a stranger"
107,101-125,20,016-020,"This time it was a short, small personage, of fair complexion, and dressed in a decent suit of dark clothes"
28,026-050,7,006-008,"‘Can you tell me the way to—"
152,151-175,28,026-030,"’ he began: when, gazing round the room to observe the nature of the company amongst whom he had fallen, his eyes lighted on the stranger in cinder-gray"
211,201-225,38,036-040,"It was just at the instant when the latter, who had thrown his mind into his song with such a will that he scarcely heeded the interruption, silenced all whispers and inquiries by bursting into his third verse:-"
29,026-050,5,003-005,"‘To-morrow is my working day,"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"Simple shepherds all -"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"To-morrow is a working day for me:"
62,076-010,13,011-015,"For the farmer’s sheep is slain, and the lad who did it ta’en,"
34,026-050,8,006-008,"And on his soul may God ha’ merc-y"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
157,151-175,27,026-030,"The stranger in the chimney-corner, waving cups with the singer so heartily that his mead splashed over on the hearth, repeated in his bass voice as before:-"
35,026-050,8,006-008,"‘And on his soul may God ha’ merc-y"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
65,076-010,12,011-015,"All this time the third stranger had been standing in the doorway"
96,076-010,17,016-020,"Finding now that he did not come forward or go on speaking, the guests particularly regarded him"
308,more,53,051-055,"They noticed to their surprise that he stood before them the picture of abject terror—his knees trembling, his hand shaking so violently that the door-latch by which he supported himself rattled audibly: his white lips were parted, and his eyes fixed on the merry officer of justice in the middle of the room"
58,051-075,12,011-015,"A moment more and he had turned, closed the door, and fled"
21,011-025,6,006-008,"‘What a man can it be"
19,011-025,4,003-005,"’ said the shepherd"
157,151-175,29,026-030,"The rest, between the awfulness of their late discovery and the odd conduct of this third visitor, looked as if they knew not what to think, and said nothing"
248,226-250,44,041-045,"Instinctively they withdrew further and further from the grim gentleman in their midst, whom some of them seemed to take for the Prince of Darkness himself; till they formed a remote circle, an empty space of floor being left between them and him -"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"‘"
32,026-050,4,003-005,"circulus, cujus centrum diabolus"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
338,more,62,more,"The room was so silent—though there were more than twenty people in it—that nothing could be heard but the patter of the rain against the window-shutters, accompanied by the occasional hiss of a stray drop that fell down the chimney into the fire, and the steady puffing of the man in the corner, who had now resumed his pipe of long clay"
37,026-050,5,003-005,"The stillness was unexpectedly broken"
104,101-125,16,016-020,"The distant sound of a gun reverberated through the air—apparently from the direction of the county-town"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"‘Be jiggered"
54,051-075,11,011-015,"’ cried the stranger who had sung the song, jumping up"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"‘What does that mean"
15,011-025,3,003-005,"’ asked several"
54,051-075,9,009-010,"‘A prisoner escaped from the jail—that’s what it means"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
12,011-025,2,000-002,"All listened"
202,201-225,40,036-040,"The sound was repeated, and none of them spoke but the man in the chimney-corner, who said quietly, ‘I’ve often been told that in this county they fire a gun at such times; but I never heard it till now"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
25,026-050,7,006-008,"‘I wonder if it is my man"
39,026-050,6,006-008,"’ murmured the personage in cinder-gray"
13,011-025,3,003-005,"‘Surely it is"
33,026-050,5,003-005,"’ said the shepherd involuntarily"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"‘And surely we’ve zeed him"
110,101-125,24,021-025,"That little man who looked in at the door by now, and quivered like a leaf when he zeed ye and heard your song"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
77,076-010,14,011-015,"‘His teeth chattered, and the breath went out of his body,’ said the dairyman"
73,076-010,14,011-015,"‘And his heart seemed to sink within him like a stone,’ said Oliver Giles"
65,076-010,12,011-015,"‘And he bolted as if he’d been shot at,’ said the hedge-carpenter"
143,126-150,26,026-030,"‘True—his teeth chattered, and his heart seemed to sink; and he bolted as if he’d been shot at,’ slowly summed up the man in the chimney-corner"
42,051-075,7,006-008,"‘I didn’t notice it,’ remarked the hangman"
133,126-150,25,021-025,"‘We were all a-wondering what made him run off in such a fright,’ faltered one of the women against the wall, ‘and now ’tis explained"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
107,101-125,18,016-020,"The firing of the alarm-gun went on at intervals, low and sullenly, and their suspicions became a certainty"
52,051-075,7,006-008,"The sinister gentleman in cinder-gray roused himself"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"‘Is there a constable here"
26,026-050,6,006-008,"’ he asked, in thick tones"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"‘If so, let him step forward"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
117,101-125,22,021-025,"The engaged man of fifty stepped quavering out from the wall, his betrothed beginning to sob on the back of the chair"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"‘You are a sworn constable"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
10,011-025,3,003-005,"‘I be, sir"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
75,076-010,13,011-015,"‘Then pursue the criminal at once, with assistance, and bring him back here"
22,026-050,5,003-005,"He can’t have gone far"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
43,051-075,9,009-010,"‘I will, sir, I will—when I’ve got my staff"
65,076-010,15,011-015,"I’ll go home and get it, and come sharp here, and start in a body"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
6,000-010,1,000-002,"‘Staff"
42,051-075,8,006-008,"—never mind your staff; the man’ll be gone"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
83,076-010,15,011-015,"‘But I can’t do nothing without my staff—can I, William, and John, and Charles Jake"
182,176-200,38,036-040,"No; for there’s the king’s royal crown a painted on en in yaller and gold, and the lion and the unicorn, so as when I raise en up and hit my prisoner, ’tis made a lawful blow thereby"
61,051-075,13,011-015,"I wouldn’t ‘tempt to take up a man without my staff—no, not I"
91,076-010,21,021-025,"If I hadn’t the law to gie me courage, why, instead o’ my taking up him he might take up me"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
111,101-125,20,016-020,"‘Now, I’m a king’s man myself; and can give you authority enough for this,’ said the formidable officer in gray"
30,026-050,7,006-008,"‘Now then, all of ye, be ready"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"Have ye any lanterns"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
25,026-050,4,003-005,"‘Yes—have ye any lanterns"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"—I demand it"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"’ said the constable"
34,026-050,6,006-008,"‘And the rest of you able-bodied—’"
35,026-050,5,003-005,"‘Able-bodied men—yes—the rest of ye"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"’ said the constable"
50,051-075,8,006-008,"‘Have you some good stout staves and pitch-forks—’"
45,051-075,8,006-008,"‘Staves and pitchforks—in the name o’ the law"
76,076-010,18,016-020,"And take ’em in yer hands and go in quest, and do as we in authority tell ye"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
44,051-075,8,006-008,"Thus aroused, the men prepared to give chase"
346,more,59,056-060,"The evidence was, indeed, though circumstantial, so convincing, that but little argument was needed to show the shepherd’s guests that after what they had seen it would look very much like connivance if they did not instantly pursue the unhappy third stranger, who could not as yet have gone more than a few hundred yards over such uneven country"
258,251-275,44,041-045,"A shepherd is always well provided with lanterns; and, lighting these hastily, and with hurdle-staves in their hands, they poured out of the door, taking a direction along the crest of the hill, away from the town, the rain having fortunately a little abated"
155,151-175,26,026-030,"Disturbed by the noise, or possibly by unpleasant dreams of her baptism, the child who had been christened began to cry heart-brokenly in the room overhead"
245,226-250,47,046-050,"These notes of grief came down through the chinks of the floor to the ears of the women below, who jumped up one by one, and seemed glad of the excuse to ascend and comfort the baby, for the incidents of the last half-hour greatly oppressed them"
89,076-010,17,016-020,"Thus in the space of two or three minutes the room on the ground-floor was deserted quite"
23,026-050,6,006-008,"But it was not for long"
135,126-150,25,021-025,"Hardly had the sound of footsteps died away when a man returned round the corner of the house from the direction the pursuers had taken"
69,076-010,12,011-015,"Peeping in at the door, and seeing nobody there, he entered leisurely"
73,076-010,14,011-015,"It was the stranger of the chimney-corner, who had gone out with the rest"
188,176-200,37,036-040,"The motive of his return was shown by his helping himself to a cut piece of skimmer-cake that lay on a ledge beside where he had sat, and which he had apparently forgotten to take with him"
121,101-125,22,021-025,"He also poured out half a cup more mead from the quantity that remained, ravenously eating and drinking these as he stood"
89,076-010,15,011-015,"He had not finished when another figure came in just as quietly—his friend in cinder-gray"
11,011-025,2,000-002,"‘O—you here"
26,026-050,5,003-005,"’ said the latter, smiling"
46,051-075,10,009-010,"‘I thought you had gone to help in the capture"
124,101-125,23,021-025,"’  And this speaker also revealed the object of his return by looking solicitously round for the fascinating mug of old mead"
90,076-010,15,011-015,"‘And I thought you had gone,’ said the other, continuing his skimmer-cake with some effort"
127,126-150,23,021-025,"‘Well, on second thoughts, I felt there were enough without me,’ said the first confidentially, ‘and such a night as it is, too"
83,076-010,14,011-015,"Besides, ’tis the business o’ the Government to take care of its criminals—not mine"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
15,011-025,4,003-005,"‘True; so it is"
56,051-075,12,011-015,"And I felt as you did, that there were enough without me"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
87,076-010,17,016-020,"‘I don’t want to break my limbs running over the humps and hollows of this wild country"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"‘Nor I neither, between you and me"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
103,101-125,16,016-020,"‘These shepherd-people are used to it—simple-minded souls, you know, stirred up to anything in a moment"
77,076-010,16,016-020,"They’ll have him ready for me before the morning, and no trouble to me at all"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
77,076-010,14,011-015,"‘They’ll have him, and we shall have saved ourselves all labour in the matter"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
11,011-025,2,000-002,"‘True, true"
88,076-010,20,016-020,"Well, my way is to Casterbridge; and ’tis as much as my legs will do to take me that far"
18,011-025,4,003-005,"Going the same way"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
22,026-050,6,006-008,"‘No, I am sorry to say"
149,126-150,31,031-035,"I have to get home over there’ (he nodded indefinitely to the right), ‘and I feel as you do, that it is quite enough for my legs to do before bedtime"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
163,151-175,30,026-030,"The other had by this time finished the mead in the mug, after which, shaking hands heartily at the door, and wishing each other well, they went their several ways"
125,101-125,22,021-025,"In the meantime the company of pursuers had reached the end of the hog’s-back elevation which dominated this part of the down"
179,176-200,34,031-035,"They had decided on no particular plan of action; and, finding that the man of the baleful trade was no longer in their company, they seemed quite unable to form any such plan now"
197,176-200,33,031-035,"They descended in all directions down the hill, and straightway several of the party fell into the snare set by Nature for all misguided midnight ramblers over this part of the cretaceous formation"
322,more,54,051-055,"The ‘lanchets,’ or flint slopes, which belted the escarpment at intervals of a dozen yards, took the less cautious ones unawares, and losing their footing on the rubbly steep they slid sharply downwards, the lanterns rolling from their hands to the bottom, and there lying on their sides till the horn was scorched through"
165,151-175,27,026-030,"When they had again gathered themselves together, the shepherd, as the man who knew the country best, took the lead, and guided them round these treacherous inclines"
220,201-225,37,036-040,"The lanterns, which seemed rather to dazzle their eyes and warn the fugitive than to assist them in the exploration, were extinguished, due silence was observed; and in this more rational order they plunged into the vale"
164,151-175,30,026-030,"It was a grassy, briery, moist defile, affording some shelter to any person who had sought it; but the party perambulated it in vain, and ascended on the other side"
88,076-010,14,011-015,"Here they wandered apart, and after an interval closed together again to report progress"
178,176-200,34,031-035,"At the second time of closing in they found themselves near a lonely ash, the single tree on this part of the coomb, probably sown there by a passing bird some fifty years before"
182,176-200,34,031-035,"And here, standing a little to one side of the trunk, as motionless as the trunk itself; appeared the man they were in quest of; his outline being well defined against the sky beyond"
42,051-075,8,006-008,"The band noiselessly drew up and faced him"
24,026-050,5,003-005,"‘Your money or your life"
48,051-075,9,009-010,"’ said the constable sternly to the still figure"
32,026-050,5,003-005,"‘No, no,’ whispered John Pitcher"
35,026-050,7,006-008,"‘’Tisn’t our side ought to say that"
75,076-010,16,016-020,"That’s the doctrine of vagabonds like him, and we be on the side of the law"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
81,076-010,12,011-015,"‘Well, well,’ replied the constable impatiently; ‘I must say something, mustn’t I"
103,101-125,20,016-020,"and if you had all the weight o’ this undertaking upon your mind, perhaps you’d say the wrong thing too"
76,076-010,14,011-015,"—Prisoner at the bar, surrender, in the name of the Father—the Crown, I mane"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
171,151-175,29,026-030,"The man under the tree seemed now to notice them for the first time, and, giving them no opportunity whatever for exhibiting their courage, he strolled slowly towards them"
99,076-010,18,016-020,"He was, indeed, the little man, the third stranger; but his trepidation had in a great measure gone"
55,051-075,11,011-015,"‘Well, travellers,’ he said, ‘did I hear ye speak to me"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
56,051-075,12,011-015,"‘You did: you’ve got to come and be our prisoner at once"
20,011-025,4,003-005,"’ said the constable"
118,101-125,22,021-025,"‘We arrest ‘ee on the charge of not biding in Casterbridge jail in a decent proper manner to be hung to-morrow morning"
46,051-075,8,006-008,"Neighbours, do your duty, and seize the culpet"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
266,251-275,41,041-045,"On hearing the charge, the man seemed enlightened, and, saying not another word, resigned himself with preternatural civility to the search-party, who, with their staves in their hands, surrounded him on all sides, and marched him back towards the shepherd’s cottage"
46,051-075,9,009-010,"It was eleven o’clock by the time they arrived"
166,151-175,30,026-030,"The light shining from the open door, a sound of men’s voices within, proclaimed to them as they approached the house that some new events had arisen in their absence"
237,226-250,35,031-035,"On entering they discovered the shepherd’s living room to be invaded by two officers from Casterbridge jail, and a well-known magistrate who lived at the nearest country-seat, intelligence of the escape having become generally circulated"
122,101-125,21,021-025,"‘Gentlemen,’ said the constable, ‘I have brought back your man—not without risk and danger; but every one must do his duty"
119,101-125,20,016-020,"He is inside this circle of able-bodied persons, who have lent me useful aid, considering their ignorance of Crown work"
32,026-050,5,003-005,"Men, bring forward your prisoner"
46,051-075,11,011-015,"’  And the third stranger was led to the light"
12,011-025,3,003-005,"‘Who is this"
27,026-050,6,006-008,"’ said one of the officials"
29,026-050,5,003-005,"‘The man,’ said the constable"
75,076-010,11,011-015,"‘Certainly not,’ said the turnkey; and the first corroborated his statement"
28,026-050,6,006-008,"‘But how can it be otherwise"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"’ asked the constable"
87,076-010,18,016-020,"‘Or why was he so terrified at sight o’ the singing instrument of the law who sat there"
110,101-125,20,016-020,"’  Here he related the strange behaviour of the third stranger on entering the house during the hangman’s song"
46,051-075,7,006-008,"‘Can’t understand it,’ said the officer coolly"
47,051-075,11,011-015,"‘All I know is that it is not the condemned man"
209,201-225,38,036-040,"He’s quite a different character from this one; a gauntish fellow, with dark hair and eyes, rather good-looking, and with a musical bass voice that if you heard it once you’d never mistake as long as you lived"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
47,051-075,7,006-008,"‘Why, souls—’twas the man in the chimney-corner"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
9,011-025,1,000-002,"‘Hey—what"
101,101-125,15,011-015,"’ said the magistrate, coming forward after inquiring particulars from the shepherd in the background"
34,026-050,7,006-008,"‘Haven’t you got the man after all"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
127,126-150,26,026-030,"‘Well, sir,’ said the constable, ‘he’s the man we were in search of, that’s true; and yet he’s not the man we were in search of"
139,126-150,28,026-030,"For the man we were in search of was not the man we wanted, sir, if you understand my everyday way; for ’twas the man in the chimney-corner"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
35,026-050,6,006-008,"‘A pretty kettle of fish altogether"
21,011-025,4,003-005,"’ said the magistrate"
47,051-075,10,009-010,"‘You had better start for the other man at once"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
41,051-075,8,006-008,"The prisoner now spoke for the first time"
94,076-010,18,016-020,"The mention of the man in the chimney-corner seemed to have moved him as nothing else could do"
82,076-010,14,011-015,"‘Sir,’ he said, stepping forward to the magistrate, ‘take no more trouble about me"
41,051-075,10,009-010,"The time is come when I may as well speak"
69,076-010,14,011-015,"I have done nothing; my crime is that the condemned man is my brother"
111,101-125,21,021-025,"Early this afternoon I left home at Shottsford to tramp it all the way to Casterbridge jail to bid him farewell"
56,051-075,12,011-015,"I was benighted, and called here to rest and ask the way"
124,101-125,25,021-025,"When I opened the door I saw before me the very man, my brother, that I thought to see in the condemned cell at Casterbridge"
267,251-275,53,051-055,"He was in this chimney-corner; and jammed close to him, so that he could not have got out if he had tried, was the executioner who’d come to take his life, singing a song about it and not knowing that it was his victim who was close by, joining in to save appearances"
113,101-125,24,021-025,"My brother looked a glance of agony at me, and I knew he meant, “Don’t reveal what you see; my life depends on it"
107,101-125,22,021-025,"”  I was so terror-struck that I could hardly stand, and, not knowing what I did, I turned and hurried away"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
106,101-125,20,016-020,"The narrator’s manner and tone had the stamp of truth, and his story made a great impression on all around"
58,051-075,12,011-015,"‘And do you know where your brother is at the present time"
22,026-050,4,003-005,"’ asked the magistrate"
9,011-025,3,003-005,"‘I do not"
46,051-075,10,009-010,"I have never seen him since I closed this door"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
81,076-010,15,011-015,"‘I can testify to that, for we’ve been between ye ever since,’ said the constable"
30,026-050,7,006-008,"‘Where does he think to fly to"
23,026-050,4,003-005,"—what is his occupation"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
34,026-050,4,003-005,"‘He’s a watch-and-clock-maker, sir"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
65,076-010,11,011-015,"‘’A said ’a was a wheelwright—a wicked rogue,’ said the constable"
75,076-010,13,011-015,"‘The wheels of clocks and watches he meant, no doubt,’ said Shepherd Fennel"
44,051-075,8,006-008,"‘I thought his hands were palish for’s trade"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
162,151-175,27,026-030,"‘Well, it appears to me that nothing can be gained by retaining this poor man in custody,’ said the magistrate; ‘your business lies with the other, unquestionably"
1,000-010,1,000-002,"’"
274,251-275,48,046-050,"And so the little man was released off-hand; but he looked nothing the less sad on that account, it being beyond the power of magistrate or constable to raze out the written troubles in his brain, for they concerned another whom he regarded with more solicitude than himself"
162,151-175,33,031-035,"When this was done, and the man had gone his way, the night was found to be so far advanced that it was deemed useless to renew the search before the next morning"
113,101-125,18,016-020,"Next day, accordingly, the quest for the clever sheep-stealer became general and keen, to all appearance at least"
181,176-200,29,026-030,"But the intended punishment was cruelly disproportioned to the transgression, and the sympathy of a great many country-folk in that district was strongly on the side of the fugitive"
165,151-175,22,021-025,"Moreover, his marvellous coolness and daring in hob-and-nobbing with the hangman, under the unprecedented circumstances of the shepherd’s party, won their admiration"
216,201-225,39,036-040,"So that it may be questioned if all those who ostensibly made themselves so busy in exploring woods and fields and lanes were quite so thorough when it came to the private examination of their own lofts and outhouses"
220,201-225,36,036-040,"Stories were afloat of a mysterious figure being occasionally seen in some old overgrown trackway or other, remote from turnpike roads; but when a search was instituted in any of these suspected quarters nobody was found"
46,051-075,8,006-008,"Thus the days and weeks passed without tidings"
72,076-010,11,011-015,"In brief; the bass-voiced man of the chimney-corner was never recaptured"
114,101-125,23,021-025,"Some said that he went across the sea, others that he did not, but buried himself in the depths of a populous city"
233,226-250,41,041-045,"At any rate, the gentleman in cinder-gray never did his morning’s work at Casterbridge, nor met anywhere at all, for business purposes, the genial comrade with whom he had passed an hour of relaxation in the lonely house on the coomb"
263,251-275,50,046-050,"The grass has long been green on the graves of Shepherd Fennel and his frugal wife; the guests who made up the christening party have mainly followed their entertainers to the tomb; the baby in whose honour they all had met is a matron in the sere and yellow leaf"
177,176-200,31,031-035,"But the arrival of the three strangers at the shepherd’s that night, and the details connected therewith, is a story as well known as ever in the country about Higher Crowstairs"
